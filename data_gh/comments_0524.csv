Even if you end up being fine seizure-wise, you'll at least have some support for the potentially extreme anxiety which will really affect your judgment as you go through it.",1704060484.0
kfr8m8k,"Hello! Going to try to get something written here before my toddler wakes up. Based on your post history, you have more cards stacked against out than most, even in the recovery community. Childhood trauma, BPD, parenting, addiction, family issues. It’s a lot. I just want to validate that to begin so that you know that I know what you’re working with. Hopelessness and planning suicide is a normal human reaction to this set of factors you have. You’re exploring the most final coping mechanism there is to deal with some pretty consistently awful stuff you’ve experienced. Not sure which other coping mechanisms you’ve explored before that besides drugs, but I’d urge you to see if there are any that seem reasonable before you make the final move. You are at your lowest emotionally and mentally right now. If we look at emotion as a spectrum, you now have a point of reference from which to gauge all future emotions. I kinda like the idea of making it an experiment. See how much joy you can seek since you’re the expert on the opposite. The work you need to do to recover from drugs and the symptoms of your mental illness is going to be difficult, but I promise you it can’t be more painful than what you’ve already been through. I am not here to promise you that life will be better all the time forever if you choose to stay. But I am here to say that you’re robbing yourself of the opportunity to find out what kind of good there is out there if you choose to leave. This world is FUCKED UP and I honestly hate it here most of the time. But holy shit am I glad I decided to stay when I did. I’ve spent the 10 years since I got sober learning all kinds of rad stuff about people and addiction and resources and avenues to take to ensure survival when the odds are stacked against you. If you’d like, you could message me and I could help you get plugged into resources near you. I know a lot about Medicaid, insurance, therapy, 12 step, recovery, mental illness, etc. I’m happy to help. I think you should stay. PM me whenever. I have notifications turned off, but I’ll see it when I open the app next. Please stay.",1704060428.0

kfq6t03,">Depends on your personal experience. As someone who has detoxed from heroin and Xanax with and without the help of detox taper meds, as well as cold turkey I have experienced some awful withdrawals. So your statement is “true” say for me. But all of our experiences are different. For someone else, post acute from coke may be a 10/10 unbearable because it is possibly the worst they have experienced. Our struggles are relative to what we have personally experienced. It’s better that we have empathy and don’t judge. Like making fun of kids in rehab that are there for just weed or adderall for example, is wrong. Don\`t kid yourself, the addiction to cocaine or any stimulant is as physical as it gets. One\`s brain literally changes its form and function.",1704046602.0
kfq0c2h,"I understand. I've thought about it. I made plans. I had a friend over the holiday shoot himself in the head because of this shit. He had too much pride to reach out for help, real help, daily help. And now I cry everytime a song comes up that he sent to me, he was my childhood friend that remained my friend in adulthood. He bought me my first legal beer at 21, got me high for the first time at 15, and now he's gone, forever. I wish I could talk to him so bad. Listen, if you are going to do it, I understand, I really do, but give yourself some more time. You're three weeks in. This is not how you will feel forever, I promise, if you work as hard in your recovery as you worked in your addiction--whatever level that was. For me it was 80 beers a week, so I had to work REAL HARD early in my sobriety. That was six years ago, and I'm not perfect, I'm coming off Kratom now, Day 8 and it sucks man, I'm right there with you. DM me anytime. You can text me, call me whatever. I won't dox you or reveal anything to anyone. Just know someone out there cares for the simple fact that we have something in common. 1.

Then keep that going, we need achievable goals to help us feel like we're making progress and give ourselves hope. Keep fighting man we've lost too many good people already. You're supposed to stay, I was looking down off a bridge so recenfly i can still feel the cold from the metal bars they put up to stop people like us from doing something tragic.

kfowqpp,"It's one of the hardest things we'll have to do in our lives, and most people don't have to go through it, but the ones who do are better off in alot of ways for it. It's so corny to say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, but in this case it really does. It takes so much mental strength, so much fortitude, and so much more to stay on track. But the only way to build those traits is by facing it head on. Some of the best people ive met are former users. It can build you into someone better than you ever thought was possible. I decided to get sober just before Christmas. Drugs and alcohol were dissolving everything I had going for me. I can't say I've been sober every day since I made that decision, but going from long benders drinking and snorting any money I had away to being sober enough to drive for the first time in months is a victory only I get to enjoy. I promise you if you give it a chance you'll start to find little things will put a smile on your face, and it will take a while but you'll start to get back into sports and hobbies you might have stopped cause of your situation. I can't tell you how close I was, and so recently, to making that same mistake you're thinking of. These past few weeks have been hell but every day that I do manage to stay sober it gets just a little better. And you'll hit setbacks man, expect them, acknowledge them, let yourself feel them, and then kick them to the curb cause you're better than whatever you're using. The best advice I got was a bit of a shocker but someone told me after my first relapse ""you'll probably relapse again, but that doesn't matter, as long as the next day you try again, and keep trying"" That hit me hard, maybe it's something you can think about when your down and out. If you do feel like making that final mistake, stop and send me a DM, I'll talk to ya about it, I've been through it, and I'm going through it now. No judgement, I don't want anything from ya, I just get it bro. That was long winded ^^ sorry for the essay, I came here for a bit of encouragement for myself, but god do I love the idea I could help someone else get through even a day of the battle.

kfo5c4t,You really fucking care for him and I can also tell that he cares about his sobriety. The fact that he continues to go to rehab means that he doesn't want to loose his life to drugs. What you can do is let him know that he is an extremely important person and no matter what happens he will always be important. Let him know that you believe in him. Hopefully in the future he will get better with the help of professionals and maybe then he might try to hit you up in order to catch up. I suggest you try to find a support group or a counselor/therapist with whom you can talk about what has happened. If insurance is an issue you can find a lot of free zoom and in person support groups for people that are in situations like yours. Your whole fucking world has changed and you need time to cope with it and you need time to heal.

My loved ones tried absolutely everything they could to stop me from using drugs (including involuntary commitment and inpatient rehab) and nothing worked until I made the decision to really throw my all in to getting sober. It would be worth making an appointment with a therapist to discuss the boundaries you need to place around yourself for protection.

I mean our own anonymity, of course, and would be disappointed in anyone who broke the anonymity of another person. Even my friends who stand proudly beside me in my recovery community are desering of enough respect that I only discuss the topic when relevant. There was a time just a few decades ago when many public figures broke their own anonymity and joined each other openly to raise awareness for addiction. Included were political figures and world renoun actors with the full support of the founders of alcoholics anonymous. They wanted to destigmatize this and other forms of mental illness.

kfkdyxu,"Benzodiazepines are false advertising. They don’t work, people just think they do; ask those around you they will tell you . I took Klonopin for 13y. I realized it was the sources of many problems and experienced a litany of parodoxal symptoms. At about 2mg. I started my taper a year ago as of this past September. Jumped in June. It certainly was the worst experience of my life and I was scared it would last for years. As of this writing I can say I dodged a bullet. I’m not a 100% but I’m night and day where I was. I have ADHD and prior to my tapering I switched from Adderall to Dexedrine. I believe Dexedrine was instrumental to my cessation of Klonopin and cannabis which I reduced probably by 3/4. I’m certain that Dexedrine made my recovery a lot easier as it helped with dopamine. Dopamine gets all over the place when one withdrawals from a drug. Amphetamines can work as an anxiolytic in some individuals, that’s why Adderall is relaxing. But Adderall wasn’t good for me and I suspect it was interacting with klonopin hence the switch to Dexedrine. Even though the withdrawal experience was horrid it was the best decision in my life tying cigarettes cessation. I would do it all over again if I had just knowing how good I feel now.

kfdzb4w,"Thank you. Was just trying to determine if it was for the sake of the child you were hanging on. (I know there is more nuance to it than that, but hard to get into.) Anyways, around 24-25 I slipped back into using with the exact same thing. Had a wonderful relationship but hid the kratom and had tried xanax again afrer years off a handful of times given by colleagues. I honestly may have done more if she wasn’t in my life, but also I was in her hometown so I didn’t have connections. It sucks to admit that’s why it mostly stayed w/ the kratom, but it is the truth. Although the high and probable consequences aren’t as intense, kratom had a grip on me the same way benzos and opiates did. I was buying cases of them and using at least two a day and it sounds like your husband is in the same boat. To be 100% direct, it seems like your husband relies on you too much. He knows you literally have to pick up his slack in regard to bills and your child’s needs. He also seems to know due to his importance to your daughter and your love that you will pick him up when he falls - I say this bc minus some of the obligations I have been that guy. I guess the next question is - what will you do if he just won’t get it together? And in turn, how can you let him know you’re serious? Moving on to helping him: He has lost his privilege to take his prescribed narcotics - If he had taken them as instructed I personally believe that would show it could be separate from his addiction. In my experience, once you abuse a med especially one given to you legally… you can’t go back outside of a hospital setting. He is lying to you and playing you. You only know bc he ran out and you’re in such close proximity. There is a chance there is even more use than you know. I realize i’m making him sound “bad” - that’s not it. He’s just like all of us here and that’s how we are when using. Kratom: although it’s “weaker” the amount he’s used is going to make him sick and useless if he quits cold turkey. If he can or you guys are financially able be needs to go to a short term detox or rehab. If that’s not an option he can do outpatient detox if it’s available (I did this once, and it did the trick and allowed me to keep working) This isn’t going to get better on its current trajectory… so again, form a plan for the probable outcomes. Hopefully he is willing to give up the ghost and immerse in getting help but if he’s currently not your just going to keep getting more of the same and similar excuse to “my doctor gave it to me” and “I’m weaning off the shots” It seems like there were warning signs to each step with his slide but each time he had (somewhat) valid reasoning and you didn’t have the energy to confront it. (Again, totally understandable to want to Keep the peace with the person you love.) but now you are all here at this point.",1703837039.0
kfdy293,MAT sobriety is still valid and I'm proud of you. & I truly do. We have been through hell and back to be honest. We are 11 years apart.

I truly believed we helped each other find our true selves we both had so much trauma. & Getting sober together just made me love him in even more watching him get better and be a great dad.

kfdoa91,"If you have a legitimate medical need for stimulants, get a supporting diagnosis. Substance use disorders/addiction are less about specific substances and more about behavior. Ive been in active recovery for opioid use disorder for well over 15 years, but i have maybe two to three drinks per month, and use cannabis once a month or so. Self medicating, which it sounds like you might be doing with stims, can spiral really quickly. Stims specifically can make you think you're being productive, when in fact you're just getting high. Not saying that's the case with you specifically, but that's what usually happens with long term stim use. Your brain convinces you that you're being productive, but the stim use is actually interfering with sleep and other body functions. Another thing to be concerned with, is you don't really know what you're going to get when you're scoring off the street. You're also putting yourself in danger with law enforcement every time you do it. Lastly, since you already know you're prone to substance use disorders (you mentioned alcohol) you need to be more vigilant about using other stuff. If you have proper support networks in place, if you're seeing a counselor, and taking other steps to make sure you're active recovery is solid, recreational use of (legal/decriminalized) substances is less of a risk, but not completely risk free.

It’s scary as hell but I promise there’s a whole (entire and intact) person in you that you’ll now have the chance to get to know. You will never be the old you again, but that’s awesome because you can be all the great things you used to be and more (and your experience with addiction means you can help others and be grateful for small things since you know hell). It’s worth it love, it really is. It’s still hard as hell, at times feels impossible, but if you want to live, fight for it ❤️",1703810939.0

kf4yvhf,"I'm not OC, but I can help you a bit, but I'm only summarizing. Essentially all of the studies that tried to demonstrate PAWS failed to do so. It was excluded from the DSM for that reason---meaning that you can never get PAWS as an official diagnosis and there will never be a medication for PAWS unless new evidence emerges, which is very unlikely. What does PAWS stand for? Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome. What is a syndrome? Well a syndrome is a defined set of symptoms that occur together due to an insult or disease that occur in that population greater than in the general population. It's a statistical definition. Lets look at how we define acute opioid withdrawal syndrome. We measure symptoms in 3 groups General population Opioid users Opioid users that just quit and what we find is that statistically only in opioid users that just quit we find that they are more likely than the other groups to exhibit sweating piloerection loose stool anxiety shaking irritablity body temperature fluctuations etc (I can't list everything) So we have used statistics to define what acute withdrawal syndrome is. When we do the same thing, but instead we look 30 or 60 days after we don't find a set of symptoms that occur at these timepoints greater than the general population. Hence we cannot define a syndrome, PAWS doesn't exist in a statistical sense. However, individuals may experience symptoms that last well beyond the acute withdrawal phase so what causes this? Well my hypothesis as also a scientist in recovery is that addicts are self medicating diseases that are masking these longer term symptoms and while doing so the disease gets worse, and so when they quit, they begin to experience symptoms again, because they have a disease or mental illness that they were self medicating. So we know that the symptom they were experiencing is NOT caused by quitting the drug from a biomechanistic point of a view (not having a drug bound to receptor is not going to cause symptoms for months---otherwise we would know this and we would diagnose PAWS in the clinic) Not all addicts have the same mental illnesses and some addicts (like myself) have no other mental illnesses and so when I quit a drug, once I get past the acute withdrawal, I never experience any symptoms. The other issue is that in recovery communities PAWS is literally ANY symptom someone experiences after quitting. Thats not how syndromes work. If I'm quitting opioids, and I'm having numbness in my big toe and my toenail is falling off, a doctor is going to say ""that is not part of opioid withdrawal syndrome"", we need to check that out. So by having PAWS being defined by addicts in recovery as literally any symptom and just chalking it up to PAWS is actually dangerous. I'm a doc that specializes in addiction (I mostly do research). If you quit a drug 60 days ago and you are having symptoms you NEED to get checked out by a doctor. And for some I would even say 30 days. Yes it is UNCOMFORTABLE becoming clean and sober, but it doesn't mean you have PAWS, you don't have a syndrome. I also think that it's dangerous to talk about PAWS as if it's a real diagnosis because the person that believes they have paws is the person that doesn't seek help because they believe its a normal part of recovery. No, if you have having medical symptoms after you go through acute withdrawals, you need to see a doctor. However many many people in recovery do have symptoms that linger on because they were masking them during drug use, while many others do not have them and worst of all some people call the uncomfortableness of dealing with life without their drug of choice PAWS. That's not a syndrome! This is not only my opinion, it's been studied, a lot in fact and there is scientific consensus that quitting drugs does not lead to a post acute withdrawal syndrome. Furthermore if PAWS was proven to exist, the syndrome would be different for every single drug---it would have to be and yet people talk about PAWS irrespective of what drug they quit--- that's how you know it's BS. Also, dopamine is not required for addiction. In the lab we can completely delete dopamine and yet animals still become ""addicted"" to morphine, heroin, and fentanyl. They will choose opioids over food if given the choice and yet they have no dopamine system at all. So no you cannot chalk everything in addiction up to dopamine. The dopamine hypothesis is almost 50 years old and we now know that it's completely wrong and yet in popular culture due to charlitans with Ph.Ds more lay people believe in the dopamine hypothesis now more than ever and it's very frustrating. Yes many drugs of abuse increase dopamine when first taken, but that isn't addiction. By the time the person is addicted dopamine is no longer involved and for opioids dopamine is never needed in the first place and I assume we will find this out about alcohol as well because alcohol releases large amounts of opioids in the brain ( more opioids than dopamine actually). Anyway if anyone has any questions feel free to DM me",1703693787.0
kf3sjjs,"Ok..so help me understand? Drugs = Super high dopamine floods. These floods cause volumetric increase of dopamine regularly causing the dopamine baseline to change and dopamine receptors to deregulate. Thus-> PAWS. The brain takes time to return to baseline.

kf3iixv,I think it it's because everything about long term lower impact brain traumas isn't common knowledge. In the movies people get concussions regularly and are fine in the next scene. Think about every time people are knocked out and are just fine a bit later. That's not true a lot of the time in real life. And surgeons don't mention that pretty much any operation that puts you on bypass comes with a big helping of depression and reduced executive function for weeks/months in many patients. It's less conspiracy than kinda hand wavy brain issues that only affect some folks but not others and you can't test for tend to get overlooked until you have to deal with them.,1703663281.0

Best friends dont take you down a path that is so fucking hard to find your way out of. He was already hooked since he had been smoking it for about a month straight. I had no idea that this shit can truly grab a hold of you from your first hit. It's literally the same as catching a disease. Since then I have been smoking it daily. Maybe took 4 or less days off since then. I have a great job which I'm on sick leave from and honestly after i kick this fucking rock in its warm ass comforting twat, i will be finding a new job to just move on from every thought. Yeeah i worked pretty much the entire time up until the end of November. I am good at masking it apparently and still never let anyone down at work. Still treated everyone with respect but i was still incredibly irresponsible. So next time you assume someone is a crackhead based on their appearance think of this...i am a good looking guy. I tuck my shirt in and took care of myself before i started sick leave. I missed quite a few days then said i must stop and get help. I have spent almost all my savings and I had a very comforting amount in my account. I have been to many many traphouses. Met many sources and did some pretty stupid shit after not sleeping for so long and literally have felt like I have went bonkers. Your mind fucking tricks you and you won't even notice till you take that first blast when you've been outpf drugs forr like an hour. ( that's how it's been for me having a bunch of money to fuel this 300-400 dollar a day this habit has turned into. So last week I have finally got to a point where the hoots aren't tasting like they used to and I can actually go a few hours after I take like 5-8 hoots and I'm not going crazy on these few hour breaks... So you know what this means. Fuck this fucking mother fucker piece of shit habit. I have 2 hoots and a few pushes left then i'm going to bed and I can honestly say that I feel like i got this and I'm not lying to myself. I am going to rehab right after new years day anyways. I have the greatest parents that I told everything to. Including looking at every inch of the floor for hours going absolutely crazy. They are here for me and love me so much. I.

kez4qbc,"Best of luck to you! I’ve done AA and NA, And at one point I had 2 years clean going to one meeting a week. Maybe more if it was a rough time. So I was pretty involved and it is not a specific religious group. What was explained to me, is you just have to find a “higher power.” And that doesn’t have to be “God”. You don’t have to read the Bible or any religious book, There is an AA book and literature but it’s really just a self help book, with what works and stories of people who have had success. A Higher Power doesn't have to be what any one religion, creed or ethos states it is - it just has to be anything at all which is bigger than me. Something outside of myself. Clearly, as I accepted, I was unable to do anything about my drinking myself. Thus, I needed to put my faith in something else. There’s a story in the AA book where this guy wasn’t religious at all and his higher power was a doorknob, because it opened the door to the room.(the AA rooms) I haven’t been in a while, I moved accross the country and never found a meeting and isolated bc I don’t know anyone here. And I relapsed and am currently fighting my way out of that. But any 12 step program is pretty good and it isn’t supposed to be religious, it’s supposed to be about finding hope that we don’t have to live like that anymore, and believing it. To each their own, but it made a difference in my life. Also following this thread. Any update? How’s the taper going? I recently started taking methadone about 2 almost 3 weeks ago. I’m on 80 mgs now and have cut down from 10 +blues a day to 1-3. I’m gunna go up a few more times and hopefully be able to just quit. I’ll probably hit up AA to help with the cravings.

It was your just getting "" legal heroin now"" my father actually called the clinic & threatened them, he was an abusive person. Long passed now, as is my sister, husband, mom, I have 1 brother left, far away. We are 12 years apart I'm the youngest. So off I went to a detox, in Greenbay WI in 2000. In 2 and a half weeks I'm down to 15mgs, & sent home to Upper Michigan, with a script for 3-5 mg pills ... I was also on benzos.. On & off, more on... Anyway 47 days after leaving GBay I'm totally suicidal.. didn't sleep a night, drank, did Xanax, still no sleep... I walked way into the woods with a hand gun, & was gonna do it . A few times, finally I have the nerve, or something, psychotic break, IDK, I "" by the grace of God"" don't know how to use a gun. I put it to my head, pull the trigger, it doesn't shoot, I look down at it, it's got a lever or a slide thing on top, I had it pointed at myself and slid it back, which made it go off, thru my chest, out my back. Apparently a neighbor heard, I was in a trailer park, and came in and saw me, next thing I know, I'm in a helicopter! I had passed out from bleeding, lung collapsed, ECT... Soon as I was given Morphine,, I was fuckin fine . NK. There was no dope up in the N. woods, so I obviously survived, went to a psych ward, not crazy, just needed opiates, to function, be normal, work! I did try 3 more times , I won't get into, No more, I was on Sub ozone for 3 or 4 months as well, I had a severe headache from it almost daily, & felt awful from the narcan in it, they won't give me Subutex , so back to a clinic. I'm now widowed, and remarried 3 yrs later to an abusive person. I'm trapped, he stole all my takehomes, 9 bottles, I got 2 weeks at a time.. So now it's daily, With no car, I have to walk. I would never do what I attempted in 2000 ever again, but there's times, I gotta say, I don't wanna be here, it's my life now, this guy, & the clinic.. . I'm going to AA, NA, counselors, trying to get away from this person. I don't have any friends, cuz he's cut me off from everyone.. it's been a long rough road, not all bad by any means, I am grateful for my life. Just gotta move, and have no car, I get SSI.. all the Medicaid benefits. But I'm very fed up. I am not young anymore, I know you can't help, but thanks for reaching out on Xmas...

kes75sn,"I don’t think I made the exact same mistake but I did make mistakes thinking that I was helping when in fact… It was the contrary. No matter what the other person goes through, whether or not they resent you for the mistake you made, you must find in your heart ♥️ the courage to forgive yourself. Or you will drag this guilt that may very well turn into shame one day. And making yourself sick over a very honest mistake (you had no idea that naltrexone would have this effect on her when withdrawing or you would have never proposed to give it to her) so this is an honest mistake. It had a kind and generous intention. Throwing it into your face later on and as you guys are breaking up is her issue and her issue only. You made amends, not only that, but as it turns out, she went to the ER which sounds like it was the safest place for her to withdraw to begin with. So again, give yourself permission to forgive yourself. Guilt that turns into shame is more than poison and it may take you down a very dark road. I am not sure how to convince you that what she did was quite inconsiderate but when we hurt, we sometimes try to hurt the ones we care the most. She was hurting and she had to hurt you in the process. Or at least, that is the way I understand the situation. Meaning if you ask her once she is calm and time has healed… she will reassure you that she knows very well: all that you did that night was help her and for that she is forever grateful. I am sorry to hear you guys are no longer together. But then again, it may be best right now for both of you. She has a lot of work to do and, though you may not be an “addict,” you may want to look at probable reasons why you did flirt with drugs and alcohol in somewhat destructive ways and your relationship to drugs and alcohol in general… I became an alcoholic when I was 43… it is never too late.

Tell him you’d like to go to one because it’s important to you and because other people will need help there too, and you want to be a part of giving and receiving that help. Ask him not to make it a big deal to the rest of your family and I’m sure he will respect that Speaking from personal experience, involving immediate family in your recovery is incredibly awkward at first but incredibly beneficial down the line.

ke6rnmf,I would encourage her to practice complete abstinence from all drugs (weed included) and do the work on herself to get to a place where she understands why she feels the need for substances. Right now in my opinion and experience she is grasping for the least damning substance (weed) in an attempt to not fully surrender to her addiction. You can not fully recover and do the hard work of self discovery till you remove any and all mind and mood altering substances. Recovery is about facing yourself and getting to the bottom of why you are the way you are and feel the way you feel and you can’t get to that place with any kind of substance that allows you to escape self which weed does. I’d be very worried of relapse to other substances if she is smoking weed because addiction is a thinking problem and if her mind is open to using a weed it leaves room for any other substance. Early recovery is really hard and uncomfortable I would recommend in patient treatment or php for her comfort and yours because you deserve serenity too. For a long time I put my parents of the front line of my addiction and they couldn’t help me at the end of the day. I needed other people in recovery and when my parents let go is when I actually achieved sobriety and I’m happy to say I recently celebrated a year. Good luck to you and your daughter you all deserve recovery.,1703085119.0

ke4iw88,"I'm a recovering alcoholic who is super paranoid about what I will take. It's been a god send for me and a huge help in keeping me sober from my DOC, which is alcohol. I also spent 10 years working in ERs and on ambulances as a medic. Here's one truth that might surprise you - a massive number of doctors use marijuana regularly. In fact it was one of the ER doctors who opened my eyes to the truth about cannabis, as he was a regular user and started a non-profit for decriminalization and wanted me to design his website. He gave me some books to read and that totally changed me. I was raised very religiously conservative so I had been taught marijuana was as bad as meth, crack, heroin, etc. IT IS NOT. Not a single one of my Psychiatrists over the years including the addiction specialists bat an eye when I tell them I use it. They're supportive. Obviously it's not going to be for everyone. But I feel like 50% of people I meet that are in recovery use cannabis. I did have one friend who couldn't use it because it would trigger him to drink. So it's good for people to be cautious when first trying it and make sure it's good for them. But yeah it's helped so many of my friends in recovery as well as myself. Some other suggestions not related to your original question, but might be useful: I would also encourage her to find a therapist she likes, cause there are so many things you gotta work through mentally and emotionally in order to stay recovered. Sometimes it takes several tries to find one that you clique with, but it's worth it. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) helped me a lot. And you can download free workbooks on those two things and practice them without a therapist as well. It's important she have a Psyciatrist that is trained in addiction. Going on Wellbutrin was the first thing that stopped my cravings after 20 years, which makes sense since it increases dopamine and most addicts have low dopamine. But I take several other things that help with other stuff that helps as well. It's also VERY important for her to be around other people in recovery, including people her age. You can usually find sober fun groups on places like MeetUp, or all the social media platforms.",1703038526.0

I really wouldn’t rely on help from doctors because it has been the single most frustrating and devastating part of my journey. If you ever get addicted you need the gold standard to detox at least. What I think you really need tho is to calm down, take some time to reflect on how you can help yourself. You sound like me, when I was starting, my mind and impulses were running me. I ended up walking out my home on several occasions to find myself in new states days later, so what I’m saying is it’s not just the using that you need to address, it’s the control, the fact that you sound hurt by others… I get it but you need to address it, you can look someone in the eye and say how you feel about it and do it with truth rather than emotion.

It's a double sided coin if you will: - At The federal level in the US it is a scheduled narcotic. The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental health disorders 5th edition (DSM5) also has its own diagnosis code for cannabis use disorder (F12's). However at certain state levels it is legalized And decriminalized. I'm not sure where you live, however if your daughter has been using those more addicting drugs, marijuana is at the bottom of the totem pole. If she's already reached that level, I would consider some outpatient therapy/treatment. That may help her understand more of the dangers of smoking marijuana while trying to recover from other substances. I'm an addiction counselor. I do not know everything. I know a little about a whole lot. But I know a hell of a lot about addiction, From personal experience and from college. Is your daughter on any maintenance (MAT) to help combat the withdrawals and cravings?? 2wks out is a good start. Education is going to be your best friend. Educate yourself, Go to Alanon meetings...

kdzn3ty,"Ok, this is a very difficult question. While weed is a drug by definition, it is also an effective recovery aid for many (but by no means all) addicts. The answer to this question really depends on your daughter, and how she uses it. If she stays stoned out of her mind all the time, then she's abusing it and it could potentially lead back to harder stuff when her tolerance gets so high it no longer has the desired effect. If it just helps to calm her, relieves anxiety and depression, helps her stay centered and takes away some of her desire to use again...well I hope she keeps doing it and you learn to accept the positive benefit it has in her life. Quick example: I'm 7 years sober from everything but weed. I nearly died to get sober, and nearly killed myself even after getting through the withdrawal and all that. Spent my first 6 months free of everything. Couldn't sleep, was in such a deep state of depression that I was drowning every moment of every day, had hell just getting out to pick up groceries or function in any meaningful way. I hated every bit of life, and wanted it to be over. Started smoking, and it opened me up. I could sleep again, I could at least start working on the depression and all it's causes, I could function. I wouldn't be here today if I didn't smoke. I'd have seen to that a long time ago. It's not an exaggeration to say it saved my life, but I'm also able to use it to my benefit, where everything else was used as a search for oblivion, no moderation, no self control, only endless destruction. I hope you'll have an open conversation with her, and as scary as the entire thing has to be for you as her parents, I hope you'll try your hardest to hear whatever it is she has to say about it. Listen to her, love her, and be there for her even if it's something you're uncomfortable with, or unable to understand. She has a long way to go to get to being even just ok. She can make it though.

U build a tolerance real quick and it takes more and more to get high. It's NEVER like it was in the beginning. After a very short time, u don't get high when using. U HAVE to use to feel normal. Like not physically ill. All that shit you're using to try to escape from will still be waiting for u when you're not high anymore. You'll now have an addiction and financial problem to compound your troubles. I've wasted almost twenty years of my life fucking around with drugs. It's only these past few years that I've tried to work on myself and my behaviors to mitigate the things that make me want to use. Getting high did not, in fact, solve my problems. Probably therapy. Talk to your Dr honestly. There may be a non-simulant that will work for your ADHD or your Dr may decide that u can safely use what's been working for you. Find yourself a tribe. It's difficult. I'm beyond blessed with the genuine friends I have in my life now. Find something u want or admire and surround yourself with people interested in the same. Pursue activities u like or that are healthy and branch out from there. Volunteer somewhere, tutor someone. I also feel lonely often. Reaching out to others is difficult as fuck. Get someone in your life that u can turn to for support. Helping someone else is a great way to get out of your own head. You'll distract yourself from things that are bothering you and it's a lesson in gratitude. Therapy will help u figure out why u want to use and develop coping mechanisms to abstain. I wish you luck. Talk about this with your family and Dr ASAP. Be open about your struggles. People can't help u if they don't know. This is prolly something you'll have to deal with your whole life. ADHD turns into all type of fun stuff as u age. If u develop coping mechanisms and critical thinking skills this early, you will have a much easier life. Feel free to DM if u want to chat.

kdugfec,"I once heard that addiction is the opposite of connection. Having issues connecting with people in the first place -- whether due to bullying, BPD, autism, intelligence, ego, etc. -- makes escaping into a warm, fuzzy world of your own all the more alluring. I say this as a fellow autistic person who comes from good external circumstances -- a loving family and little in the way of material struggles -- who anyway struggles to manage the low-level discomfort of daily life. That discomfort gets amplified when you're a high performer. The greater the stress you live under, the greater the comfort you may find from sitting alone in your bedroom, following the substance use rituals you know by muscle memory. If you're a reader who isn't scared off by long novels, I'd highly recommend Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. It's a book that does an incredible job at representing wicked-smart high achievers with substance abuse issues. It may help you feel less alone to spend some time in Wallace's head. To see that no matter how smart you are, a maddening number of people just as smart as you have had the same struggles. You are not alone. Anything that tethers you to the world -- anything that provides a healthy, safe kind of connection to others, or even just yourself -- even just a big-ass book that proves other people have walked your path before you -- is worth holding onto, tight.",1702870060.0

My art education and process also became diluted by substance abuse. I lost full faith in my ability or drive to make art during my recovery, but it's starting to come back. First few months of my recovery I could barely even hold a pencil my nervous system was wrecked. I was so lost in my head I couldn't observe deeply the world around me. Just spiral around the shame and traumas. That's where I really lost faith. I thought I was permanently broken. I really appreciate the people who told me during this period that to be an artist is a permanent part of my identity. Like it's a walk in life once you self identify and the urge to create will come back when I'm ready. It's true in my experience. We just need time. I also needed to address my perfectionism at its root. Still a work in progress. The more I heal my soul the more my creative spirit feels compelled to make again. Two things that have helped: I felt like an imposter but during this crisis I taught an art camp to kids. Helping them make art and just create to create inspired me immensely. Maybe try doing some service around art or ed. Being around children is amazing. They're so curious and uninhibited. A lot to relearn from them. Second thing, I've been making rock weavings. Like little twill patterns around rocks I find with embroidery thread. My friend held a workshop at her house about a month ago and another artist taught us over zoom. I felt like she gave me this gift back of wanting to make things. Maybe instead of drawing or painting try learning really lax processes. With this rock stuff I get to work with my hands, make choices about color, meditate on the patterns, which rock I want. IDK I'm trying to keep it simple because I just know I deserve and need the grace. Go easy on yourself. Are there ways to be creative again that are stepping stones back to painting? Creative exercises in color or whatever else? It's building a lively discipline as much as anything. Also have you read The Art Spirit by Robert Henri? or The Artists Way by Julia Cameron?",1702859706.0

In that sense, it's healthier for me to think about this as ""I will show him love and support because I love and support him"". For me, that idea of ""if I do X, then person will do Y"" tends to reinforce this belief that I have more of an impact on a situation than I actually do. I'm not saying don't show love and support. But the way I experienced it, love and support only helped me believe I could recover. It didn't do anything to make me want to recover though.

I couldn't bear the idea that I would throw away my sense of self and my opportunity to live my actual life for a drug. There was no middle road option. I was either going to literally swim in brain soup until I died or have a whole ass life with a career and friends and self-worth and shit. And actually, I got to that point prior to rehab. Rehab helped too but I only went there because I had decided to quit. Rehab just provided me a safe place to rest and mentally recover, honestly. To put it simply, nothing external pushed me to recover. I hit an internal breaking point because I was horrified by the realization that I was literally throwing my sense of self and my life away.

I unfortunately thought it was a job that was beneath me, due to a ton of unwarranted pride and entitlement that I brought with me into sobriety. It ended up being a life changing lesson of how we’re not the job we do, but the person we are. I was somehow happier making close to minimum wage (but great health benefits) than I had been showing up to my grinding office job under the influence. Thats due to the work I was putting into my recovery outside of work and applying those lessons there. I also learned a ton about resentments and being one part of a team, as opposed to the guy controlling everything outwardly or inwardly. I went from seeing my coworkers as lazy and selfish losers to actually people who were doing their best and being pretty damn good at it too.

kdbkygv,"...but it's nice to know this sub exists. Me: divorced 50-something who - in recovery - from alcoholism/cocaine - was divorced after second time my spouse found my shameful secrets of porn history and correspondence with others like me. My reason for my bleak Outlook is that I was diagnosed with severe depression after multiple psychward trips memento-ed by multiple pairs of sticky psychward socks in my dresser (😉). For most of the subsequent years since that diagnosis, I scoffed at it taking cues from past generations by telling myself to quit crying and put big boy pants on. This is factored in with that I began using and became addicted to methamphetamine two years ago. I don't need to bother going on about the two addictions co-conspiring because you all know. I know from a neuro-receptor/ brain chemistry standpoint that my past and persistent anedonia experienced during periods of abstinence - that always sent me back to relapse - will pale on comparison to what would lie ahead if I went into yet another treatment center. Pre-meth, the endless concoction of different medications, individual and group therapy, DBT, that has gone on for so many decades, wasn't effective. Now adding in my meth abuse/stim fapping into the mix spells out my fate and to a degree, I've mostly accepted it. For anyone considering the possibility that I might just be an asshole, for whatever it's worth, that is what I often lean toward. When I'm gone (which isn't nearly soon enough), my hope is that there will be further innovations in therapy and medicine that will help those going through this along with preventing future addicts.

I think that I didn't realize the extent of my depression at that time or tie it to the klonopin withdrawal, but it faded eventually (and with other medication to help). The restless leg feeling isn't 100% gone, but it has lessened enough that I don't even notice it the majority of time. With all of that said, I 100% agree with you about being forced off your medication. I switched to a new provider who was willing to prescribe it as long as I needed to transition off of it but in tapering doses. I was okay with that because I had wanted to switch for a few years, but my previous psychiatrist was dramatically opposed to the idea (and now I understand why).

That’s all dependent on your rehab and what works for you but it’s not the kinda drug that you have to go off cold turkey.

My mom died of lung cancer after a 4 month bout at 64 years old. I sat by her side while we went through with medical assistance in dying. It was the most painful experience of my life. The only reason I stayed clean through it is because I am a member of NA. I’m a musician too, I go to dozens of concerts and perform often and I assure you live music isn’t the answer. Meetings, fellowship, service, connection, recovery, steps, sponsorship, higher power - this shit will keep you clean if you open your mind to it. Give yourself a break!

kcsiy5w,"Addiction is a disease that affects us mentally, physically and spiritually, turning us into obsessive, compulsive and self centred individuals. You’re right in that it exists whether or not people are using drugs or not. However, recovery is only possible with complete abstinence. I’m coming up on 5 years clean and my mind still tries to convince me I know everything and I don’t need help and since I’ve been clean for so long I can do this on my own. However, if I did everything my brain suggests, I’d be eating ice cream for breakfast, cocaine for lunch, and come dinner time I’ve emptied my bank account and I’m at the casino putting all my money into a slot machine. It doesn’t take long for me to blow my life up without a program. I would say that being clean without a program is arguably more painful than using. At least when we’re using, we don’t have to feel. When abstinent, we’re no longer numb to our emotions. Recovery opens up the opportunity to learn to accept the way that we feel. I know now that for myself, I used drugs to change the way that I feel. Recovery teaches me to accept the way that I feel and accept life on life’s terms.",1702231434.0

I know tonnes of people who have it all and they are miserable. I’d highly recommend sharing your experience with people who can relate, such as others in recovery, meetings, detoxes, recovery houses, etc. Great opportunity to get out of yourself. I know the feeling of being alone in a room of people, it’s super uncomfortable. But for me, when I share my experience, strength and hope with people who can relate, it reminds me of how far I’ve actually and I get the benefits of having helped others stay clean as well.

kcr9gdk,"Anything that is mind and mood altering should be off limits, including alcohol. The thing is, you may not be an alcoholic but not only can you become one, but that one day you get tipsy you might have a “fuck it” moment when you decide to relapse on opioids, which is dangerous to mix. It’s even more dangerous because after those 3 weeks your body will have no tolerance over opioids, meaning that if you needed, idk, mg of whatever drug to get high, now you’d only need a fraction of that, even less with alcohol. That’s how people overdose. In their mind, they can still handle the same 30 mg, but your body simply can’t. This is why relapse is deadly. This can also happen with weed, which can lead to opioids, same way as alcohol does. I learned the hard way when I put anything before my recovery, I lost it. I lost great, amazing jobs and career opportunities because I didn’t have my recovery first. That being said, is it possible to take a semester off? No only can you die if you relapse, but if you make it it can be a rollercoaster of one bad decision after another that can even land you in jail. Please try to take more time off, and then do php with sober living. Stay in the sober living as long as possible. Go go AA/ NA meetings and pay attention when individuals speak, when you hear someone who has a story that you can relate to, or you really feel like you can connect, ask them to sponsor you. The big book is great and you need a sponsor to guide you, or you’ll miss the true meaning of the steps. Afterwards, sponsoring someone will keep you sober. When you’ve invested so much time and made connections, you’ll be very unlikely to relapse. You meet so many wonderful people who understand and are willing to help, all you need to do is ask. We are here for you. Please don’t wait until this horrible disease takes away everything you love from your life. Don’t wait till you overdose, and “make it back.” Marcan is not 100% efficient, many don’t come back from that first use. As an alcoholic, I’m so blessed I haven’t gotten a DUI. I chose to change my life before I got one, before I killed someone or myself. Please think about this. Good luck!",1702209664.0

kcml4p3,"It really sounds like you could have narcolepsy and that is a serious condition. You should REALLY talk to your doctor who can set up the sleep study or who will refer you to a neurologist who can. They can potentially treat this and you'll feel like a new person (this is coming from a friend who discovered she had narcolepsy in college.) A sleep study doesn't cost anything if you have Medicaid or Medicare or most insurances in the US. I had to have 3 in-hospital/office sleep studies at 22 years old and discovered I have horrible central AND obstructive sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea means my brain forgets to breathe when I'm sleeping so my brain ""wakes up"" every few seconds the entire time I think I'm asleep which causes my extreme fatigue. Both my parents and some of my siblings and other family in other states had them and didn't pay anything. I'm serious though, a sleep study may be able to help and really improve your quality of life. All you have to do is say to your doctor, ""I'm always exhausted and can't stay awake. I would like to have a sleep study done."" The doctors don't care either way, they just approve it and insurance covers it. It's nothing complicated. You would have to stop taking all the drugs for at least a few days before the sleep study because certain drugs can alter the results, especially having stimulants in your system. I really think you should bring this up with your doctor though.",1702126840.0
kcls7uq,"I feel this so much. I'm figuring it out for myself right now. I think that to return to the things I used to love and expecting to feel the same joy and passion I used to feel is too much pressure for me right now. I think I need the dopamine hits of doing new things or doing the things I used to love, but in a new way. So I'm finding new hiking trails and trying new craft hobbies that are similar to ones I did in the past; maybe they build on old skills that I had, but the overall project is new to me. Doing challenges like looking for all the local hiking trails that have old homesteads on them, or looking for a certain kind of tree, that kind of thing attaches new rewards and lights up similar pathways the drugs do and that'll help rewire your relationship to pleasure and joy. For you it might look like seeking out places you've never fished before, trying to cook a cuisine you've never cooked before. Maybe teaching a kid how to fish or work on cars. Maybe volunteering to do some trail restoration or something like that. Things that feed connection would be helpful. Also, for me, I went so hard for the last few years, I had to come to terms with the fact that I'm fucking exhausted. I just burnt myself out and all those interactions with unhealthy people kind of fucked me up a little bit and I actually need to just rest a lot and be really gentle with myself and allow myself to slow down. A few months ago I was pushing myself really hard to engage with new hobbies and I kind of got overwhelmed and so I just stopped and started laying in bed reading and watching TV shows and letting myself just recover.

They recommended u spend 6 months in residence, but u could leave sooner or later at your discretion. They all had standards and rules that helped u get back on track. U have to work, go to school, or volunteer. U have to go to a certain amount of meetings or therapy each week. If going to meetings, they monitored your progress. Are u working steps, do u have a sponsor? Most had weekly house meetings and chore charts. All had curfews and restrictions on overnights and guests. No guests of the opposite sex in the house. Usually, no overnights for the first month. Dropping when u return from an overnight. Every house kicked u out for using. Different ones had different consequences for breaking their rules. Some had me write an essay. Some had me pay $100 to return if I dropped dirty. Always had to test clean before returning. Probably look for another sober living house. Not sure of your situation, but look for a house near your resources. Do u need to be near mass transit, like a bus line or subway? Will family and friends be helping you? Maybe near them. Do u receive benefits or services from the county u live in? Sounds like Mom's house is triggering. Prolly not near her. Do u have a job? Court? Drs? Try to live near that stuff. Make things easy and set yourself up for success. Sober houses are tools. It's up to us to utilize the tools we are given. They are businesses at the end of the day and most I saw were motivated by money, not helping people. It's up to u to find one that works for u. There's lots of weird power plays and shady shit in these homes also. Taking advantage of people in recovery who aren't familiar with the process or have no way of advocating for themselves. I think prioritize a location that will benefit u most. Ask around the community u frequent for recommendations. Meetings, therapy, church. I wish u luck. Whatever u do, don't use.

Perhaps I could help some of them. They in turn might help others."" Bill W had been through the wringer, they thought he was going to die of the disease, they told Lois that he was going to die, he was broke, lost his fortune, his house, everything he valued. He wasn't trying to help others to keep himself sober. Bill told his story to help people. Period. He knew he had been blessed and he wanted that to increase to grow, he was grateful. He had no idea at all if it would work for anyone other than himself, but he was going to try. He was so convinced of his recovery that when he wrote how it works, it had to be toned down from never have we seen a person fail who has throughly followed out path. It's true that nothing snaps a sober alcoholic out of the doldrums like talking to a drunk. Excellent medicine, I use it a lot. The intrepetion that you use allows groups to shut down wet alcholics, kick them out meetings, tell them to take the cotton out of their ears and put it in their mouths ad nauseum. Etc.etc etc. We are told in step 11 to have our thinking cleared of self seeking, self pity and dishonesty. We do not help other alcholics in order to get insurance against losing our sober benefits, the nice house, the job, the family, we help them because we have begun the process of psychic change which allows us a connection to a higher power, which keeps us sober.

kcbodcf,"Early recovery is a full time job, you don’t have time to play games. Two people that haven’t figured out how to do life on their own are in no position to help someone else figure out theirs. Strong relationships are composed of two people who could do life on their own but choose to do it together. Early recovery is the time to figure out how to forgive ourselves, to love ourselves, to respect ourselves enough to stop poisoning our bodies and minds with our addictions. This is a second chance at adulthood, to become who you WANT to be, not who you used to be! I think by putting that love/attention towards a relationship you’re potentially robbing yourself of the foundation of self sufficiency and self esteem that everything else in a stable life needs to be built upon. By building that foundation somewhere other than yourself I think you’re setting yourself up for failure if/when he relapses or you break up. The percentage of people that stay sober a year, even a month are shockingly low. The percentage of people who stay sober when the other half of their new relationship relapses is probably even lower. You should explore the new relationship emotions with a therapist while they’re visceral, if you’ve had a history of toxic relationships then what you feel right now might be an important piece of the puzzle. Get your moneys worth in rehab, it should be hard work but it’s still kinda nice to take something of a timeout from the world. Spill your guts to your therapist, go to every activity no matter how dorky, do your homework, connect platonically with your housemates, try to get some rest in.

I eat a lot of egg yolks and liver and fermented foods (the brain prefers fat or it will crave sugar). I walk a lot. Meditate and have a prayer and gratitude practice. You can practice the steps, surely, that's a form of prayer and action. Even non addicts use it. AA is also something that made me continue thinking about drinking. I decided to ask my partner for support, and make health my focus instead of focusing on staying away from the bottle. I know that's not what most people want to hear. But I was actually tired of thinking about drinking, then talking about it in AA - relapse still happened. This way seems more health focused and, also talking to other people here when needed. My diet and lifestyle is changing my brain so that I do not have my brain screaming for alcohol and sugar.

kbyrtyv,"This is someone who isn’t interested in actual help, not the kind that’s going to do anything for them and you want this more than they do. If a person isn’t willing to do literally anything to recover regardless of what that entails and do so with zero reservations doing the legwork you’re currently doing themselves? Not a chance in hell this goes anywhere. None. Less than 1%. The criteria laid out doesn’t exist, no legitimate treatment center is going to let someone keep their phone and skip half of what people do in treatment, which is group work. These are both absolutes in any efficacious treatment program. Someone who’s been to treatment and is handing you those qualifiers as the only way they’ll go is knowingly handing you something that’s impossible to find in order to appease you. Even if you found somewhere that doesn’t exist, which: 1.) Was a luxury rehab that excludes the states where 90% of the luxury rehabs are. 2.) Allowed people to not attend groups. 3.) Allowed people to keep their phones. 4.) Isn’t about the money or squeezing every dime out of every person who walks in with absolutely no fucks given about what they do the second they’re no longer paying them. 5.) Only caters to adults. It wouldn’t be able to take an addict with that many demands of a recovery process and that narrow of criteria and make them into an addict who’s ready to do anything that’s going to matter. Barely agreeing to go is worse than refusing to go because the end results will be the same, it’ll just cost a bunch of money. An addict who walks across the country and begs to get in to Betty Ford and stays for the full duration plus residential and hits every single meeting and takes advantage of every single option made available to them including sober living and after care still relapses at a 60% rate within 30 days of leaving treatment. That addict still relapses at an 80% rate within the first year of treatment. It a person has been to one treatment center they’ve essentially been to all of them, there isn’t anything magical about a rehab with palm trees and therapy animals at it. The processes are the same, most involve the same twelve step facilitation, all do group CBT / processing groups, all tell you the exact same things and none of them do a single thing to keep you clean the minute you walk out the door. The most willing and desperate addict who will do anything to recover is working with those odds and realities. You’re dragging your friend there and doing all the work they should be doing themselves if they actually want this. You’re welcome to do whatever you want but rather than trying to find treatment for them, I’d suggest finding Al-Anon or Nar-Anon meetings for you. At least someone gets better in this situation that way.",1701705114.0

Otherwise, if I have energy, it’s something like woodworking or wire wrapping. The smell of freshly cut wood is therapeutic, and bending wires really helps keep me distracted. I used to paint, but lately I can’t get myself to focus long enough. If I’m really stressed, forcing myself to clean my kitchen or start a load of laundry, so that the next day I have it a little easier… no mess to wake up to in the morning really helps set the tone of the day. If I’m struggling to start, I tell myself “just pick up ONE thing… complete ONE task,” and before I know it I’m cleaning my kitchen, vacuuming, picking up clutter… and on a roll. Getting out of a slump or breaking through a streak of depression or procrastination just starts with one thing at a time. Take a shower. Brush your teeth.

I’m an addict of 8 years, dealing with anything from psychedelics, Benzos, speed, to fentanyl and herion. I was a very heavy smoker for 6-7 years and I promise you buddy your OK. Work on your breathing. Count in your head up to a desired number as you inhale and then count down as you exhale. Slow your heart rate. Your heart rate is one of the physical aspects of anxiety you can control. In my experience just breathing and distracting your mind with counting and only focusing on those two things, slow my heart and in return usually shifts moments of anxiety to moments of clarity. It sounds like you are so hyper focused on thinking that qutting smoking weed is ruining your mental. I promise you it’s NOT. Bro I’ve been through some of the worst withdrawals possible. It’s all a mental game. I see it as a bad trip that I need to get through. Currently I am trying to stop smoking fentanyl. The withdrawals make me feel as if I was taken to hell.

I was lucky as fuck. I straight up stopped using after a while. i think I had one the very last time i took one a 2mg full bar, I was sober up until last month, i was overcome with life’s bullshit and i did it cause i was being selfish. regardless. I can honestly say, i was miserable, i smoked weed incessantly, i still do, i go through wax cartridges within days, it was the only thing that really helped me, the only real medical size affect i got from taking them, was the INTENSE, stomach pain and nausea, i was taken to ER and had paramedics show up to my house cause i couldn’t move, i couldn’t eat, and i was just shaking and sad and fucking depressed, it’s going to eat you away, and you will be a husk, but when you come back from it, from my experience, you’re able to resist.

kazjktj,"Sorry for the long reply but I got inspired… 😜 The home group I was in asked (but not prohibited) to refrain sharing if under the influence as it may trigger someone who is new or, at the time, fragile (thinking of drinking, going through cravings…) I always thought that this request to be reasonable not only because it may trigger someone but because each time someone who was “wasted” did share, their speech made no sense at all and would tend to drag on. Yet, on rare occasions, someone drunk would share. He or she was never interrupted or told to be quiet. And at the ten minutes mark would be thanked for their sharing and asked to allow someone else to share. I have never been to an AA meeting where anyone was not welcomed. Though a bit out of subject, this conversation reminds me of a situation our group experienced and is another example of the AA principle: Anyone who desires to stop drinking is welcome. At one point, we had a couple who started to deal Kratom at meetings. For months, the chair person asked the couple to stop their activity. I was the only one to say that we should get the authorities involved. Everyone else told me that I was in no position to tell someone else there weren’t welcomed. It went on for a year or two until the situation got out of hand and the cops got involved. I completely understand the perspective that says that a room of AA should always welcome people who “ask” for help. It is a beautiful principle but not very realistic in my opinion. this “ideal” allows for individuals who are ill intended or are not “ready” or serious about recovery to impede (even take advantage or abuse…) those who are serious and honest about their recovery. Not all AA member means well. But this is my opinion. I, of course, respect yours.",1701100740.0

kayt5ky,Let me ask this….how is day drinking helping you out of your current living situation? How long do you think your friends are going to let you stay there while you are drinking your money away? Even if you aren’t ready to stop drinking (which in my opinion you probably should for now) you should ask yourself if drinking is actually helping you out of your current situation.,1701088281.0

kax1w1l,"You should definitely go to some meetings and listen to what people are saying with an open mind. At open meetings you can just say your name or ""I'm new"" or something like that. When you introduce yourself at the closed meetings say that you are trying to cut back on drinking or that you ""drink too much."" People will have some opinions about this and they might laugh or joke with you about it but I think you will still be welcome. Nobody is going to co-sign on your opinion about yourself that you can learn to moderate your drinking. But just sit there and listen to what people are saying. Definitely don't speak in the meeting itself if you have had a drink that day. Some members may wish to speak to your privately or offer to speak to you about it. Generally speaking, those of us who have been around for quite awhile have shared the advice that men talk to me and women talk to women. I mention this because some members may find ""non-binary"" to be confusing when it comes to that particular practice. Different groups will vary in terms of how quick they are to pick up on things like pronouns and gender non-conforming and gender identity. But again, people tend to share phone numbers and offer rides to a person of their same gender and they could be confused or flummoxed by the non-binary identity. Many years ago, probably at least 20 years ago there was a person at my home group who told us that they were a different gender that didn't really fit into the idea of male or female. The person had recently gotten out of treatment and wasn't sure if they wanted to permanently quit drinking or not. It was not a big deal. Most people are pretty focused on the singleness of purpose which is helping the alcoholic who is in need of assistance to recover. So these parts of your identity might bring some questions. But they are not reasons to exclude a person from meetings but I just want you to know that it might come up. The general advice of ""listen for the similarities, not the differences"" is going to be very solid advice for you and everyone, honestly. Pick up some of the books if you can. The meetings will have them for sale for maybe around $10. They will have pamphlets that might be free or they might cost a dollar or so.",1701049026.0
kawjfr1,"Also, AA is not a moderation program. Yet, you are always welcome. I believe that if you are drinking, you are asked to not share in meetings. Yet, anyone who struggles with alcoholism is welcomed. I am sure that it could help you even if just a little… and it is free!",1701041626.0
kas99mc,"At my rehab, the number of people who were there of their own volition (like me) was really low. It was primarily people who came as an alternative to more jail time. They didn't necessarily want to be there, so it was a lot more about letting them know that relapse happens, and that doesn't mean you have to give up. You can always try again. That recovery isn't only a one and done. We don't shoot our wounded, we patch them up again and again, until it (hopefully) sticks. Addiction is a progressive disease and active addiction only ever ends in death. So if pushing ""relapse is okay, it happens often, just come back"" helps people save their life, it's valid. It just doesn't mean it's inevitable.",1700966009.0

kannuy7,"First and foremost, congrats on starting your active recovery. Physical exercise can be a part of what helps you recover, but there are a few other important things to consider as well. Have you seen a doctor? Try finding a doctor with experience treating opioid use disorders(OUD). A doctor can help you establish a baseline for your health too. A physical and full blood panel is a good place to start. A doctor with experience in treating opioid use disorders or substance use disorders in general, can also help you figure out if your situation warrants medication assisted treatment. Assuming you are through the acute withdrawal part of your recovery, keeping post acute withdrawal syndrome from derailing your progress is important, and medication may help you in that area. In addition to finding a doctor, talking to a counselor with addiction treatment experience, preferably with experience treating OUD, is extremely helpful early in the recovery process. Its especially important since you are so young. Setting up a strong foundation now will help you for the rest of your life. Before starting any kind of exercise routine, you really should be checked out by a doctor. In terms of cardio specifically, if you have access to a gym, the easiest (relatively speaking) way of increasing conditioning is on a treadmill with a heart monitor. After warming up (3 min) you'll want to get yourself to somewhere between 130-140 beats per min. Shoot for a speed of 3 to 3.5 and an incline of 3 to 5 to begin with, you'll want to do 25 to 30 min total. Its going to feel crappy the first few days, but you'll build up quickly. The main thing is doing it at least 4 days each week, if you can manage more, great. Adjust everything based on your heart rate. You'll notice in a few weeks that you'll need a bigger incline and faster speed to maintain the same heart rate. Doing it at a gym also makes it easier to add weight training to your routine. TLDR: Active recovery is the most important thing. Find a doctor and counselor with addiction treatment experience to help you stay in active recovery for life. Treadmill with heart monitor 4 days a week or more.",1700886137.0

kakr3xw,"I worked at a private detox facility for substance use disorders that is nationally known as Sunrise Detox. At the time I did not realize the harm I was causing as a therapist eager to help clients through a crisis. Being in recovery myself and treatment being helpful, sunrise preached the importance of aftercare and treatment. But what they neglected to inform staff was how the referral process works. As best practice, it should not matter who the referral was from, the client should be assessed properly and determined what facility will meet their needs. Sunrise would inform staff never to offer alternative options for patients if they had a referral and if they did not have a referral the director would have predetermined affiliated treatment centers for each insurance that we had to influence and manipulate families and the patient to believe this is their best option for success . Some were in Florida, North Carolina and California. Sunrise is owned by praesum health and they have outpatient and sober living facilities in NJ, FL, and now Mass under their umbrella with sunrise. It looks like one outpatient center called the counseling center, owned by praesum and affiliated with sunrise Tom’s River NJ had a more than half their staff quit. praesum has detoxes in FL, NJ, GA, NY and Mass only accepting private insurance. They tend to encourage clients to fly out of state for aftercare treatment. With private insurance there are more options than state insurance and clients are lied to by directors that their insurance only covers facilities the company they had special relationships with. Clients were never given a chance to research but rather were just offered other affiliated aftercare facilities making it appear the client is making their own decisions unknowingly they can just call the back of their insurance card and decide an aftercare option based on their needs. Therapists acted as marketers as they sold clients and families the idea of recovery and successful outcomes. The therapist never vetted the treatment centers nor did they base the aftercare plan based on client needs but rather based on insurance, finances and the relationships they have with questionable treatment centers. This is a form of malpractice as clients insurance coverage and benefits, business referrals and false information are put before clients needs. Clients and families were lied to believe the treatment facility or affiliated facilities are in network and their best chances for recovery outcomes. Therapist called clients families behind clients backs to influence the importance of this aftercare plan and to encourage them to set boundaries, such as threatening to leave or the threat of homeless, if their loved one refused after care. Because substance use disorder is a family disease marketeers prey on the loved ones of the client. Families and loved ones were used as a tool to essentially threaten to disengage and threaten to withhold support to that person if they do not comply with the facility’s recommendations. They would call it educating families but in reality it was coaching loved ones to threaten their loved ones with drastic consequences such as divorce, homelessness, disconnection from the family and many other threats depending on the case. younger adults who are dependent on their parents are the most susceptible to fall victim to these predatory practices disguised as a cure to the problem. They use the moral values of recovery and used them in way to manipulate uneducated wealthy families into believing this false narrative that their loved one will have the best chances at recovery if they do not deviate from the original plan and or must attend treatment or they will essentially die. Clients where always recommended for the highest level of care for aftercare due to the higher insurance payout. Any outpatient plans were dismissed by staff determining every client to need intensive care no matter what the situation was even if client has employment obligations, family obligations, academic obligations and other important factors that are ignored.

ka5htp3,"You are not alone. We are all connected, every bird, every tree, every thing. You struggle within your own mind, as many of us have and will. It requires you to change your perspective. A paradigm shift. I recommend group work to start. Having support from friends and family is good but often 1 to 1. In group you will see connection and support in a different light. Sounds like you also struggle with being judgemental and respectful towards yourself. The idea that you will never be good enough is inherently false. You are good enough now. Society imposes a belief upon yourself that you allow to take root. Focus on loving yourself first, actually loving and embracing who you are, looking at recovery as a tool to help you heal the parts of you that are wounded and leaving behind pieces of you that do not serve the life you desire.

ka0uluz,"Hi! Are you me? Same diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, I started meds in detox and then after my intensive outpatient ended when I got the ADHD diagnosis! I’m so happy you’re getting answers and treatment! I’ve been sober for 3.4 years off drugs and alcohol and been medicated for both BPD and ADHD almost the entire time and medication has been life changing! I did not do well on SSRIs at all, I was on four (I should have tried two and then moved on to another category but my old psych sucked) and dealing with a ton of BPD provider stigma. In detox they switched me to a tetracyclic antidepressant, kept me on an anxiety med, and added one to prevent nightmares from PTSD. I stabilized hardcore within two weeks, it felt miraculous. A curious new psych went back over my history and brought up how I’d started using meth to self medicate the intense pressure/stress on my brain of ADHD and stabilize myself, and got me tested for ADHD, and on a weighted ranking of 15-85 (15 = profound, 85 = absolutely zero sign of ADD/HD) I was hitting 23/25s. As a former stimulant abuser I started Strattera, the only non stim on the market for ADHD, and it was amazing. I won’t lie onboarding the Strattera did have a few downsides while my blood serum level stabilized. I strongly advise cutting out caffeine and adding in tiny increases in total ounces to keep any jittery/amped feeling down, and to take only on a full stomach. I moved onward and upward over three months of dosages and felt better and better each few days, and then one day every side effect vanished never to return. But yes, medication has worked wonders to achieve stability that I can build my sobriety on, maintain my serenity, and has eliminated the drive to do impulsive things which has been extremely helpful being ADHD and managing triggers through non habit forming alternatives. It’s been a solid foundation to manage the mental illness so I can focus on my spirituality, stay grounded and keep a running introspection throughout my day.

You can’t do much of anything for him but get out of the way and focus on yourself, that’s what love looks like in addiction relationship dynamics.

k9uw89s,"Some thoughts: Keep in mind the following is just one alcoholic's opinion: - It feels like you're being exploited because you are being exploited. Trust your gut. - Pay back what? Tradition 8 (assuming you have some connection with 12 steps, if not, still an interesting read) states: “[Whatever] Anonymous should remain forever non-professional, but our service centers may employ special workers.” You're straddling the line between special worker and professional. Sober Houses cannot function without - as you have discovered - full time work by managers. You have however many beds in the house, that are not manager beds... 4? 5? 6? All being managed by a position that's being paid exactly 0 dollars, That's 180x5x4=3600 bucks a month income to the property owner. Paying back? Paying back is taking a dude out to a cup of coffee after a meeting a sharing your experience and strength and hope. Maybe sitting with that guy for a few hours a week and going into more detail. Picking him up for a meeting, dropping him off. Making the coffee, opening the door at the meeting, being a meeting secretary. Allowing a property owner to pocket 3600 dollars a month with salary-free property management is certainly paying somebody, but it's not paying 'it' back. You want to pay 'it' back, where I assume by 'it' you mean 'the people that helped save my life,' right? Take a step back and think about exactly where that work might be to help save someone's life outside of being an unpaid property manager at a for-profit company. - I get it, some people really do feel like they are contributing by being house managers. These people typically do not have jobs, and actually serve as the house managers as their 'full time' jobs until they get fully back on their feet and get employed again in a normal job.

I actually got clean to con a judge not to send me to prison for my 9th dui and possession. I was angry at myself for letting it get that bad once again. It has been said alot that anything I put ahead of my recovery, I will lose. So, my career ( recovery coach) would obviously end if I was to use. My Indian Chieftain, my house, my wife all would be gone. People don't get clean because they have found success, happiness, or love while they are using. They get clean because they have lost what they cared most about. I get it you're hurting, lost, alone, and afraid. You got a couple of choices. Keep doing what you're doing, to see how much lower you can go. Unfortunately with the way the drug seen is today that will be in a pine box sooner than later. I have watched to many good people die from fucking Fentanyl in the last few years, even those who swore they didn't use it. I hope you choose to get your ass some help.

You need a way to get more than only a week or two sober. You still aren't even really thinking clearly at that point yet. Get a month in rehab at least. Try to figure out a way to make this happen. Yeah going to rehab can fuck with your employment. But damn idk sounds like a shitty job anyway threatening to cut your hours. You gotta get somewhat of a fresh start going for yourself. Detox, go to rehab if possible, hit meetings or whatever as much as possible etc. Only THEN you'll be able start working on your depression and family relationships and life.

Not every addict or alcoholic is going to do the wrong thing with money given to them. Early recovery or long term addicts can and will do the right thing with money if they have the desire to stay clean.

k8hm3ik,"I think this is the hardest part for anyone that chooses sobriety at any age. I struggled at first when my friends would call (I was in rehab 3 months) to reconnect and ask me to go out. I’d tell them I don’t drink anymore and their reply would be that they don’t drink that much anymore either. Nine of them wanted to hang and go to a movie or go bowling or anything, it all revolves around substances. I’ve had to find a whole new set of friends now and it took time to do, there a lot more that socialize with substance than without. But the friends that you will meet now are going to be truer people. That’s what I’ve found anyways. I’ve had to adapt in many ways. Find different things to do where I meet different types of people. It can be very challenging because it’s not as quick of a process. I’ve been sober 9 years. My first 5 I struggled and was very hurt how so many of my friends didn’t stand by me and support me in my sobriety. I ended up changing my phone number because the ones I bought pills and such from were relentless. It’s what I needed to do, not necessarily what I wanted to do but it helped me keep a straight path. I wish you the best and stay strong in your new beliefs. You will be a happier and healthier person because of it.",1699529916.0

k8hebya,"If you fail, you try another path. There's never only one path. If you fail that path, you try another. And if one of those paths feels ""devastating"" to consider it's because you've placed a condition on your future. That if it isn't this, or that, or ther other, then that's unacceptable and devastating. What i'm humbly suggesting from someone who has literally been where you've been, is that the path to happiness is much, much more broad than you're able to see right now. Everything feels huge, and permanent, and non-negotiable in college. Every decision feels like it's life or death. None of them are. Not one. Well, besides maybe considering to continue to use or drink alcoholically. That one will very likely end up life or death. Now, we're not supposed to give medical advice here, so this isn't that. But something that definitely helped me, besides pursuing a program of recovery, is therapy. I'm positive your university offers it, and likely free of charge for students. You sound like you're dealing with a lot, and quite possibly more than just the mental anguish that comes with chronically self-medicating with drugs and alcohol. Also, I'm positive you wouldn't say that you're putting conditions on your sobriety. I also believe you when you're saying that most of you wants to be sober but a little part doesn't. That little part is the part that's preventing you from thinking clearly on this. It's the part that's making you say ""I can stay sober if..."" and then following it with anything other than ""I don't drink and follow a program of recovery."" That little part wants us to feel like we're unique. That we or our situation makes something that worked for others won't work for us. It does this because those feelings are necessary if it wants us to keep drinking and usuing. What I've found is that I was never nearly as unique as I thought, not even among alcoholics and addicts. Take some time and get sober first. Take as long as you need and, if necessary, put as much other stuff on hold while you do it. Work a program and put everything you can into it. Fold in therapy too, it can only help the depression and any other mental health issues you're struggling with. Get your feet back under you, and get your head back to being able to think clearly. Then, work on the stuff you want to get out of life. And don't let any single day or audition or school make you feel like if you failed once, that it means the pursuit is over. Again, I promise you're worth the effort.",1699524213.0
k8haptj,"Let's put aside for a moment that you're putting conditions on your sobriety while upending your current plans to pursue a dream. A great dream, and one I genuinely hope that you succeed at, but a dream nonetheless. Why do you think pursuing a career in music has the necessity of passing an audition? Are you trying to get into a specific show, or a musical conservatory? I went to a musical conservatory and I understand the pressure you might feel to get into the right one, or your career is over before it begins. That's a lie. And one I suspect your real desire to give yourself a good excuse to keep using/drinking is telling you so that you can say ""See! I tried! What's the point?!"" The point is, you can pursue everything and anything you want if you're sober. You can pursue it as a passion, or a career, or a hobby, or anything in between. But if you are just setting up arbitrary 'goals' whose real purpose is to act as good excuses, you sound a lot like me before i ultimately got sober. So I absolutely get it. Here's what worked for me. I stopped bullshitting myself. I stopped placing conditions on my health and need for sobriety. I asked for help, and I followed directions. Pretty quickly, I realized that a ton of what I thought I wanted or needed was really just me putting things in my own way so that I could never be satisfied. 11 years on, I'm still sober. And now I find the satisfaction often really just lies with the effort, not the results. I rarely have any real control over the results of my efforts, but If i put the effort in to achieve the things I want, then I can be satisfied knowing I did all I could. You're worth the effort my friend.",1699521255.0

k8f2l5p,"Sorry for writing so much, I got carried away. I know how hard it is to read and pay attention newly clean so I’ll put a short version TL:DR - Yes you absolutely can recover, no you are not too old at all. Getting back to normal is going to take a while, but hopefully on your recovery journey you’ll find a whole new better you and a whole new better life. Good luck on your journey When I was in rehab there was a guy who worked there that was a heroin and ice addict for almost 40 years. He would tell us that with everything he did for so long, that he statistically should not be alive. But he was. And not only was he alive, he was 8 years sober and helping others get sober too. One thing I’ve learned in recovery is that it’s never too late to change for the better. I guarantee you that if you go to any rehab or any group recovery program, you will not be anywhere near the oldest one there. Some people might even be jealous that you’re trying to get clean so young compared to them lol. Heck, at the meetings I go to there will be maybe 2 or 3 people there under 30. You have so much more life to live and you can absolutely come back from any situation you’re in. If you haven’t decided what you’re going to do that’s okay, I would suggest to just look up a YouTube video of a recovery story. There are some amazing stories out there of what people overcame. As to getting back to feeling normal, yes you absolutely can, but it will take a little time. I was an ice addict too and even though I wasn’t addicted long(less than a year) it still took quite a bit of time to feel like myself again completely. The process of getting yourself back and learning things about yourself that you never knew, having new experiences, connecting with people like never before, and working to become an even better person than you were is a journey that has no comparison. Sorry for the long rant but I truly feel for you, I was there once and I know how aweful it feels. You got this though.

k8argpr,"I’m also trying to get off it and just wanted to say I totally understand why you asked. At least for me personally I’ve noticed some NA people/meetings are super accepting and others sometimes make me feel like idk.. I’m not a real addict or something? It helps to remind myself I don’t have to tell them what I’m trying to get off of if I feel like the group is gonna be that way. The majority of the time it’s fine and tbh as I say this I realize I could be projecting- but as someone coming from the same situation I get it. Curious if you’re abusing it or just trying to go off it because if it’s the latter I might just be careful about wording. I’ve abused the hell out of mine but I know a friend of mine who didn’t abuse theirs and when they went off it the withdrawal was still really shitty. So if you’re looking for a place to go to connect with people around that I might just focus on the withdrawal aspect. I don’t think anyone would be mean or anything, but they might not be as validating cause when you abuse a drug it’s just a different thing going on. But I would want people experiencing the withdrawal to feel comfortable coming and hearing our stories and stuff so I hope the rest of the community would feel the same. I rambled and worded that poorly but at least I can blame it on withdrawal 😂 - either way free to message me!! Talking about it definitely helps. Also would recommend the stop speeding sub on Reddit and joining their discord and the recovery underground discord. They have NA meetings via audio and it’s very relaxed and honestly I’m glad it was my introduction to NA. If you don’t have discord or don’t want to get it www.intherooms.com can help you find online meetings I know when I first started and was feeling the same way just popping in and listening was helpful to get a feel for what an in person meeting might be like ♥️",1699407219.0
k8aqndl,"Hey, I totally get where you're coming from. It can be really tough to walk into a new space, especially one as intimate as NA, and feel like the odd one out. I've been in similar boats, where it feels like you're wearing a sign that says ""Newbie"" in neon lights. But here's the thing, and you've touched on a great point – a lot of the time, that sense of feeling unwelcome is our own brains doing a number on us. It's like our minds are these overly dramatic directors of movies that are way too invested in the theme of isolation. It sounds like you're really putting in the effort to challenge those negative thoughts, which is huge. That's a battle in itself, and every little victory where you don't let those delusions rule is a step forward. And hey, not giving a shit can be a superpower when it's about shedding off that concern over what others think. Sometimes, it might also help to have someone in your corner, rooting for you and offering a different perspective. It's like having a personal trainer for your mental health. For me, seeking out a bit of extra support made a big difference. It's a space where you can talk about those feelings of being unwelcome or unlikeable without any judgment, you know? Sometimes a little professional insight can go a long way in finding new strategies to tackle those old, sticky thoughts. If that piques your interest, you might want to check out getting some more personalized support _HYPERLINK_ In the meantime, I'm rooting for you at those meetings. Stick it out, and who knows?

Then you’ll be around groups of people you’re individually comfortable with and it’ll keep getting better. For me at least a lot of my mental dysfunction is centered around feeling unwelcome, left out, rejected and unlikable in almost every situation. My brain looks for details to confirm this because it’s been my way since I was a little kid. I have to fight it to rule those negative delusions. And now that I’ve been fighting for a while I’m getting better at figuring out when that’s actually true or not, and the confidence I’m gaining along the way is helping me to not actually give a shit.

A counselor with treatment experience can help you decide if you need to see a doctor for medication assisted treatment. Some of the stuff you're describing sounds like depression, and that's something a doctor may be able to help you with. As far as relapsing is concerned, as my counselor used to tell me, ""play the tape to its conclusion."" Meaning go through in your mind what that relapse would look like. You've been through it enough times to know that using just once wont be enough, and if not just once, then how many times? Will ten times be enough? Will 20 do the trick? You know in the end that no matter how much you use, it will not be enough to satisfy you or change anything for the better. Then there's the practical side of trying to score. The possibility of getting caught by the cops, getting ripped off, having what you're buying cut with something, etc etc. Addiction thrives on isolation. You mentioned not having any friends, see if there are support groups near you, maybe reach out to loved ones, siblings, for support.

He can go to meetings when he wants, in my experience there are meetings available for early morning, lunchtime, and then the evening ones. The anonymity will allow him to keep it on his terms.

k82brih,Please go get real help so you can be good to others. People in AA aren't here for your ego. You are what's considered a dry drunk .Look at your response to OP. You are filled with anger & hate. The only cover you have for that is AA. You have the newcomer to take it out on and to turn it around on. I don't say that with hate. You have all the characteristics of a dry drunk who hides behind AA. You get angered by people who have problems w/ AA but your ego wont let you see it's because of people like you. You have years of sobriety. Congratulations but you are still a prick. Have a good day.,1699276224.0

k807t6r,When my alcohol withdrawals became so unbearable that I decided I wanted to go to medical treatment for detoxing. It was the hardest thing to admit to my mother I genuinely needed fucking help because I was in such a poor condition.,1699230771.0
k7z5tjs,"At the age of 21 when I realized buying my own alcohol is going to be a big problem. I quit drinking for Goode 4 1/2 years ago at the age of 31. So a decade of alcoholism later, I finally quit for good. But then I develop this habit of relapsing on hard drugs. Earlier this year, I was very lucky to have woken up. I nodded out and I woke up on my floor after sliding off my chair. I am so lucky I woke up. I then realized my dearest friend was the only person outside of my Building Manager with a key to my apartment. He always sent me a good morning text and if I had not responded at all, he would’ve been very worried. I was also a Methadone at the time so I was usually he was the one to say good morning first since I showed up at the clinic at 6 AM. I am now seven months over I am off methadone and on Sublocade the long acting Suboxone shot. After I realized I would’ve traumatized my dearest friend because he would’ve found my body, I begin to understand that the gravity, in the levity of how much my drug use was hurting all my loved ones. I care about them so much, and I never stopped loving them in addiction. That was the last time I used. I get emotional talking about it, or writing about it, because I almost didn’t wake up and that it was almost the end for me. And I think about my cat trying to wake me up and with my friend would’ve walked into. Just breaks my heart so I am done. I am sober now and I’m never going back. I’ve made up my mind. I don’t do any 12 step programs I don’t particularly agree with the theology or the fact that total abstinence is the goal because we need to focus on harm reduction more than we do total abstinence. We’re hardwired to ingest substances, and fall into addiction, and then we get sober. We fall back into it for a moment, get ourselves out, and then we are shamed for it. We lose our queen time which doesn’t feel good. So we need to start celebrating people who reduce their usage and people who may not be 100% abstinent but I have stopped ruining their lives with whatever substance they were dealing with. Total absence for everyone is completely unrealistic. It’s like teaching abstinence only sex education. It doesn’t work. It doesn’t fucking work and we need to take a hard look at this as the recovery community and figure out how we are going to handle these people who cut back significantly and they should be celebrated for it. They should still be able to access their medication that helps them cut back to that level. I know people are going to argue with me, but 100% abstinence it’s just unrealistic across-the-board. We see it with absent. It’s only sex, education, and we see it with Alcoholics Anonymous and there are 3 to 6% success rate. If you’re somebody who is cut back your usage to the point where you’re no longer throw your life away and you’re moving forward in life than you made some big steps in my book. You’re in recovery. Your recovery is valid. We need to take a hard look at a Harm Reduction, and we need to take a hard look at medication’s for addiction here in the United States weather be for opiate use for methamphetamine either one that has a myriad of medication is available for treatment and we don’t utilize it. I believe and safe use sites. I believe in prescription diacetylmorphine or Dilaudid for addicts you will never stop using. Giving them Methadone at night to hold them over to the morning and then they are supervised while they use the prescription strength diacetylmorphine. We need drugs like Kadian which is the 24 hour morphine compound that can be tailored to the persons specific dosage needs much like methadone. Don’t even get me started on methadone I’m just gonna leave that out. We need it dextroamphetamine in high high doses available to methamphetamine addicts. There’s a study in Seattle that was done a few years ago, where they used a drug called Dexedrine to treat methamphetamine addicts, and it was highly successful. Just like methadone they showed up and got their dosage for the day. We need to prioritize adding more MAT drugs into the mix. We take a hard look at Methadone and how it’s distributed and how methadone has not had an update and around 50 to 70 years. As a former Methadone patient, I can tell you where is absolute hell. We need to do better and we need to celebrate every single win. 100% abstinence is not going to work for every single human being out there. We see that in the data we see that in practice we see that all across the board. We need better access to treatment as a whole.",1699216462.0

I even jumped off the golf cart at my security guard job because I thought the lighting was gonna hit me. And just crippling darkest depression I had for months feels not worth it, none of it.

That means you can do this too!!! I can not express enough how proud of you I am!!! Hydration: Encourage your client to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and flush out toxins. Balanced diet: Suggest a nutritious diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to support their overall well-being. Exercise: Regular physical activity, such as walking or light exercises, can help boost mood, reduce anxiety, and improve sleep quality. Meditation and deep breathing: Teach your client relaxation techniques like meditation and deep breathing exercises to manage stress and promote a sense of calm. Support groups: Recommend joining support groups or attending counseling sessions to connect with others who have gone through similar experiences. This can provide a sense of community and understanding. Distraction techniques: Encourage engaging in activities that can divert their attention from withdrawal symptoms, such as reading, listening to music, or pursuing hobbies. Sleep hygiene: Advise your client to establish a consistent sleep routine, create a comfortable sleep environment, and practice relaxation techniques before bed to improve sleep quality. Herbal remedies: Suggest exploring natural remedies like chamomile tea, lavender essential oil, or valerian root, which may help promote relaxation and sleep. Mindfulness practices: Introduce mindfulness exercises, such as mindful eating or body scans, to help your client stay present and manage cravings or discomfort.",1699117950.0

I didn’t even realize that the “no motivation” thing was even connected to suboxone until I switched to subtext for my taper. It’s crazy how much different I felt. My mood was better because I had more energy. I looked forward to things again. I’m glad to see that it’s not just me experiencing these issues bc it gives me hope to stay on my taper bc I’m almost to the end of it. I’ve just got to put my mind to it at this point. I was taking 16mg a day from 2019 to March 2022. I then tapered down to 8mg a day, then 4mg a day. I also didn’t take my doses at once. For example, when I was on 8mg, I took 4mg in the AM and 4mg in the PM. Im still doing this with 0.25mg in the AM and 0.25mg in the PM. At this point it feels silly to even still be taking it but it’s such a mental fuck for me. I psyche myself out every time. I do believe I need to get off of it though bc of all the aforementioned side effects. I don’t want the other guy to go in on me about not needing to get off of it like he did for OP.

k7sgjpm,"""Benefits for use outweigh these risks and oral care can help"" is included right in the title of the link you provided. You accepting the first thing you read or hear without asking for sources says more about you being a ""simpleton"" than me. Some of the ""ai generated info"" you provided comes from cases where the risk to a mothers life was higher without the use of Buprenorphine and is there to make doctors aware of discontinuation syndrome, basically a form of physical withdrawal, that can occur in a new born if the mother was on Buprenorphine throughout the pregnancy. If you bothered to read the thread, the point being made is that addiction is a chronic illness that can sometimes require life long medication. The viewpoint that people need to ""get off"" medications that are effectively treating their illness is unique to substance use disorder treatment. Every medication can have some side effects, but the stigma surrounding addiction treatment is unique. No one is telling diabetics, people with high blood pressure, or other chronic illnesses ""stop taking your medication.""",1699107250.0

Think about it: we have one hour to communicate with each other and we waste 25% of that time mindlessly reading a script. Any deviation from this procedure is denounced as heresy. It's one of the many reasons that we NEED a new program for addicts. I support AA/NA only because its the biggest game in town.

While it is possible to successfully get into and stay in active recovery without a doctor, the lack of structure and accountability are usually big stumbling blocks. I also highly recommend that he see an individual counselor with a background in substance use disorder treatment, and that both of you go to a couples counselor, if you can find a counselor that has a background in treatment it may be helpful. As others have mentioned, the simplest way to know is to get the 12 panel cups on Amazon and ask him to use it while you're watching without notice.

k7gdnrd,"I'm sorry to hear this and I hope that time will heal some of those wounds. However, as a former addict I can tell you that it was not your fault. The things I've done while using, the lies I've told my family, friends and my partner at the time. I was diabolic. Once I went on a holiday with my partner and we were in a single bedroom with a small toilet. I had to have a line as it was usual every night but didn't know what to do. I thought that if she heard me locking the door, she would have thought I was doing something I shouldn't have been doing. So I came up with this solution: enter the toilet and turn the key to lock the door in the exact moment the door closed, so that it would sound like a single noise. This is the level of insanity that addiction creates. I then proceeded to crash a pill and have my massive line (obviously while flushing the toilet). She even tried to come in and found that the door was closed. ""Oh, I must have locked it on autopilot"", I said. ""But give me a minute and I'll be out"". I stopped snorting only when during one night I couldn't breathe anymore,I had short breath and thought I wasn't gonna make it to the next day. Took me years to quit from that shit and I'm grateful that I managed. So, it is terrible that the events unfolded like this but it really is not your fault if you haven't noticed or it happened when it was too late. If someone is on a quest for self-destruction they will eventually get there, it is sad that really it's their cry for help that nobody hears. But I think that nobody's got ears for that kind of cry.",1698891345.0
k7g2uzg,"Your post was a bit unclear, subs make you feel like a zombie? That sounds like a dosage problem. I've been in active recovery for over 15 years, I've never felt that way on buprenorphine (suboxone) I've been stable on doses as low as 2mg per day. Talk to your doctor about getting back on bupe, keep adjusting the dose until you're stable without the side effect that was bothering you. Kratom is a full opioid agonist, second highest alkaloid content after the opium poppy. It also binds to non opioid receptors in the brain. Stay away from that stuff. Opioid use disorder is a chronic illness, like any other chronic illness it can be effectively treated with medication. People who suffer from diabetes or hypertension dont just decide they no longer need their medication. I'm confident you can find a doctor with opioid use disorder treatment experience that can help you find the right dose of buprenorphine. As far as your partner goes, you two should for sure go to couples counseling. Counseling in general is good, at any point in life, but it sounds like it can help you greatly. I've been with my wife since high school, we did 2 years of couples counseling, it made a huge and positive impact on our lives.",1698886875.0
k7f6j5j,"I'm an addict in recovery. When in active addiction I will lie to anyone, everyone and myself to protect my addiction. For me, this was not out of hostility, resentment or antagonism- it was simply my addict brain struggling to stay alive. Currently in recovery, I would have no problem pee testing for anyone that cares about me. You can get tests on Amazon. As an addict I don't feel entitled to the blind trust of the people that I've lied to, broken trust with and destroyed in the past. Trust your gut- do not be tricked into collaborating. If you have control over the finances or they have access to your finances, I would shut that all down immediately until you have some medical reassurance that your partner hasn't gone down that rabbit hole again. Its very hard to understand if you haven't been an addict yourself(although I think in this society pretty much everyone is an addict- the difference is just what is legal, socially acceptable and fucks up your day-to-day life), but try not to approach this with anger, shame, hostility- I almost guarantee that your partner feels like shit if they are using or will as soon as they stop. Addicts tend to lack self-love, drown in shame and do not give themselves the compassion and care that they would give an animal. Getting good treatment is so essential. Relapse is very often a part of recovery. Some people get it right the first time- but that statistic is very, very small. I know people that have been to rehab multiple times. I think the important thing is to try and catch it quickly. They will feel better the less damage they are allowed to do, seriously. And I agree, sometimes the relationship has to get put on hold for both of your sakes, truly. Sometimes people aren't ready to get better and sometimes they want to get better but haven't gotten the help they need to do it properly. Addicts need alot of structure, community, purpose to fill the hole they've been using to cover over. All just my opinion- but I wish you and your partner the best and hope you both get what you need.",1698873965.0
k7dnwmg,"Sorry for your and their struggle. From the info given, something is up. As addicts, there's things we can't or don't do to maintain our sobriety. We can't hold on to old paraphernalia because it's a reminder and tempting. That stuff should have been thrown out and a discussion should have been had to acknowledge it. Not a brush under the rug type of incident. Most striking for me is your description of their behavior. It's an honest program and we addicts are well aware that we have distrust to overcome. When confronted or questioned, I would expect a clean addict not to become combative or defensive. We know we've fucked up in the past and it's not unreasonable for our loved ones to question. Personally, I would acknowledge your concerns about my behaviors and try to figure out why I'm exhibiting addict behavior. If there's another reason, partner should still be able to accept and understand your feelings and concerns, and try to examine themselves and their behavior. Suboxone is the devil. I'm not a fan at all. Does your partner actually need an opiate? Not judging if they have a medical condition or chronic pain. Heroin is my drug of choice. I'm two years clean this time with the help of vivitrol. It's a once monthly shot that makes opiates and alcohol not work and controls cravings as well. Suboxone has other therapeutic uses, so this may not be an option. I recommend looking into vivitrol and doing whatever u can to get them off the Suboxone if possible. Trust your instincts. Good luck, I hope your partner finds a healthy and happy life.",1698854101.0

k7crstl,"Wow, this is the most relatable thing I’ve seen. My boyfriend was addicted to blues for a year before he met me. I used to be addicted 3 years ago so that was a major red flag and I told him I can’t be around someone doing them because I’m not comfortable jeopardizing my own sobriety for you. So he promised he would quit for me. We were spending all day everyday together for about 6 months and I wasn’t noticing any signs that he was using. Something happened between us and we didn’t have contact or see each other for about a month. During that time period I had moved into a new house. Once we began contacting again it was mostly over the phone and only briefly in person. I was lonely in my house though and really missed him so I moved him into my house with me. After like 2 days I started seeing signs. There were more and more everyday. At first it was the tiny pupils. And then it was the irritability. And then it was the “falling asleep” super randomly… like in the car on the way home from work or when I came back upstairs from making food. I had asked him a couple times if he was back doing drugs and he would always say of course not I know you would break up with me if I was. So I tried to believe him. But one night I could see some stuff in his nose. So when he was sleeping I stuck my finger in there and flaked some stuff onto my hand. It was blue pill crumbs! I woke him up and was like dude what is this? He played stupid. He was like I have absolutely no idea but I’m sleeping leave me alone. I said dude I’m not stupid I know blue stuff doesn’t just appear in peoples noses. Mind you he kept trying to wipe the crumbs off my hand the whole time I was talking to him because he didn’t want me to have much proof. He continued to deny it and was making me feel like I was an awful person for “accusing him”. He was like I agree that it looks like blues but it’s not I swear. So I let him go back to bed. While he was sleeping I started investigating. I went through his phone. I found cashapp payments for $200 multiple times to random people. All recently. These were drug payments. I finally found his wallet and went through it. There was an empty bag full of powder on one side and a bag with 35 blues on the other. I was so disappointed. I took them all from him and hid them, cleaned his credit cards off and just went to bed. He woke me up at 7 am absolutely frantic freaking out saying “you went through my wallet?!!!!” I was like yes! I knew you were lying to me. He asked what I did with them and I told him I flushed them. He said “all of them??” bro what? 😭 like no, I saved you one 😂 anyway I told him he wasn’t allowed to live in my house anymore if he was just gonna lie to me and do drugs and put me at risk. He swore over and over that he would never do them again if I didn’t make him move back home. I told him I didn’t trust him and he needed to go to rehab. He was crying and begging and making me feel awful. So I let him stay. Literally the next day, I left to go pick up my friend and bring her over. When I got home, he was about to get in the shower but I had to pee so I went in there and closed the door. I noticed he had his wallet in the bathroom with him. I don’t take my wallet with me to shower so I was suspicious. I opened it and there was fresh residue all over his card. No pills but definitely residue. I opened the door and was just so upset. I told him I was 100% sure that he bought more because I cleaned his cards with Clorox wipes last night and now there is fresh powder on them. He kept trying to convince me it was old. But his pupils were tiny and he was not acting sober. I grabbed the pocket of his pants and felt drugs in there. I asked him to take out whatever was in his pocket and he was like no there’s nothing in there. I reached for it and he threw me against the wall and ran outside. He never used to be physical. I asked my friend to go follow him and make sure he didnt go take the drugs. I took his phone and started texting his mom and sending her pictures of the drugs but acting like I was him and telling her “I need to go to rehab” so she would come get him. She did. He didn’t go to rehab though and 3 days later I found out he had passed away. I was destroyed. I felt like it was all my fault. I’m sharing this story so that what happened to me doesn’t happen to you. People are afraid to admit their addictions, but you need to find a way to get them help before it’s too late. My boyfriend killed himself because he felt like a failure and it was too hard for him to quit. Please get your partner help. Bicyclehealth.com is an online opioid addiction recovery program. They will prescribe Buprenorphine and suboxone which stimulates one opioid receptor, shuts off the rest, and makes it impossible to overdose. It is possible to recover in a pain free and simple way. Beg them to give it a chance. It worked for me. I got addicted right after my boyfriend died. I wanted to understand how he could pick drugs over me. Were they that great? Well I got addicted again after being 3 years sober and they weren’t great. So I got clean. Again. It was so much easier using bicycle health and what they prescribed then the first time I was addicted and I tried to get clean over and over and over by myself but always gave up because it was too hard. Please don’t let your situation end how my boyfriends did. He passed away August 20th 2023 and I am still an absolute mess. I lost my boyfriend and my bestfriend because I didn’t know how to help him. Please do better then me. Don’t let your partner die because you are afraid of being wrong. If you see signs, take action. Signs don’t just randomly appear unless there is something going on. Please message me if you have any questions or just want to talk.",1698840370.0
k7cp4ly,"I absolutely agree. I got them runs in the family stuff as well... I've really tried to have an open dialogue and given plenty of moments to come clean so to speak. I have my own mental health issues (on a waiting list for therapy again) so I guess that's where the blame of myself comes from. Kind of a"" if I didn't do this or if I was a little more present then it wouldn't be like this"" kind of thing. I leave for work before sunrise and return after (exhaustion leaves me somewhat distant unintentionally). I have up to 2-6 beers 3-4 nights a week. I sell drugs legally for a living (it helped me kick my own opiate addiction). How do I defend that? I'm still relying on drugs while telling someone to get sober? I believe that we make our own choices and have to live up to them but I also understand the choices an addict makes aren't necessarily their own. Forgive my curiosity, please dm or ignore if you're not comfortable, you say you've been on the other side of this but also alluded to your own journey with addiction and I'd be very interested to hear (or read) a bit about your journey to today.",1698838837.0
k7cmzdq,I’ve just been there on the other end of this. Stealing lying and generally doing everything I had to do to feed the addiction so I also have an ex I loved that I tried to help but in the end did her a disservice so it’s a lot like you said but you have the momentum and I think this can end up being one of the most rewarding experiences of your life but your partner needs to be “called out” for lack of a better term. Get it all out in the open and then when you can see it all in the light and know what options may be available you it’s going to be clear to you what moves you two need to make and when something isn’t working then don’t be afraid to try something new. Us addicts aren’t all bad we just aren’t well lol so I really hope they see how much you care and are willing to make the decision to change. Sorry for rambling but also there are going to be bumps and mistakes. Just move on and use it as experience. Beating yourself or them up for failing will get you nowhere just learn and move on.

k7cks06,"I have mixed feelings about treatment tbh. I’ve been to an embarrassing number of them over 10/11 years and I relapsed after each (not to say they didn’t help whatsoever but like others said, it kind of feels like an “AA/NA or no way” philosophy for most which is unfortunate. It’s like you have to conform to a certain narrative and buy into it wholeheartedly or they don’t think you’ll be successful (which is bullsh$t). There are certain positives (you get to have a complete dopamine detox usually meaning no phone, caffeine, sugary food etc), that allows you to atleast reset your dopamine receptors and set them up to be more sensitive to natural rewards like socializing and exercise. Some of the better ones will do CBT and if you get a good therapist this will help a little but NONE of them explain why you go through this and I mean really why. Biologically what’s happening and why certain practices are put into place, none of them asked the “right” questions or helped me to find the “right” answers for me. After many failed attempts, I started researching the neuroscience and psychology behind dif practices and I learned the concept of neuroplasticity (the ability of the brain to change based on new experiences) but it helps tremendously if you know how to do it and why. That’s how I got clean and have stayed clean. You’d think we’d have an overhaul of treatment philosophies since there’s a low success rate but apparently no one cares enough to invest in education in these places. 1 last thing, it’s hard for “normies” to understand what trying hard looks like and basically no one understands the underlying mechanisms of addiction which makes it so difficult on the person suffering. My best advice is to educate yourself that way you have a leg to stand on in an argument/discussion around treatment and your desire to quit using the substance. I’ve started trying to do my part in educating others so if you need help with this message me or I created a fb page called “The Addicted Brain” if you wanna check it out",1698836052.0
k7ckcqa,I 100% get what you are saying and not giving up on the person is extremely kind of you. In my opinion I think you should approach them as a person that cares about their wellbeing and not trying to prove they are lying or trying to prove a point I think just saying “ we need to have a conversation about your past addiction issues and what I feel are some issues that you may be having that aren’t being addressed” you will probably get a little push back or maybe they are even waiting for someone to help them and are too proud to ask just reassure them that you are there for them and want to help but obviously you know something is going on with them. I’m not being dramatic here but honestly their life is really at stake here and honestly whatever your relationship is with them needs to take a big backseat to their recovery and I’m in no way saying that you should split up or divorce or anything but the most important thing for them and you is for them to get help. Beyond any relationship or financial or family obligations that they may have they need help. I learned this the hard way with my ex. I won’t bore you with what happened but addiction is insidious and when you start lying about using it’s not a real big leap to start lying about everything. Addiction can’t be cured obviously so all you can do is treat it. I suggest you explore the sublocade shot and if their provider doesn’t offer it then find someone that will. I’m not sure what you know about Suboxone or Sublocade but those on their own isn’t enough they need either counseling or therapist or someone that they can talk to. They are something like 17x more likely to relapse with Suboxone/sublocade alone than with them and counseling. The outpatient will keep them accountable. It sounds like they are willing to help themselves but they need to be treated. I hated even the idea that I couldn’t stop using without help it goes against every instinct a person has about privacy and no one wants to admit they aren’t in control. Just from what you have said already they are willing to try and that’s great. Going to rehab again isn’t going to help in my opinion but outpatient will help and if they try and don’t like it try a different one. Your partner/spouse is sick and that’s all they just need treatment. I think you may want to consider how far you are willing to go because although it gets easier in time it never goes away they will always have to be treated so it’s not going to be easy. If you want to talk about it more I work graveyard so I’m up all night. Anyway good luck and I think your concern is genuine and your partner needs help.,1698835761.0
k7cgofi,I totally get where you are coming from and I’ve seen people that trade their addictions for addiction to 12 step whichever flavor. I will say I’ve seen it help people and also that god is not a requirement in theory but in reality it’s a Christian fellowship in practice in my opinion and not necessarily bad as I’ve been to really great meeting and some real cult type of meetings like you describe. The contradictions in 12 step are difficult for me to ignore and when I went to rehab it was optional one of the meetings and the other I had to attend and although I didn’t like the meeting I did get stuff out of the meetings but everything you said I agree with it can be really scary when 20-30 people with addiction problems get together. I’m glad it helps some people but for me it was a very tiny part of me getting sober.,1698833070.0
k7cg00g,"I’d say as an addict I’d advise you to trust your gut. If something seems off I’d bet that it is. A person doesn’t have a chance unless they want to change and that means things like friends, places and things. I can tell you that if they were forced to change by circumstance like pressure from spouse/partner in my opinion that’s never a good enough reason for an addict we have to 100% want to change our lives. From your post and the fact you posted here leads me to believe you think something is up and I’d say that you probably know the person best so you must know how they were when using and how they are acting now. Sadly I think the suspicion you feel is never going to go away until they address the problem. Just going to rehab is not really going to help to be honest. Ongoing treatment is what is going to make the difference get them signed up at your local outpatient treatment center and this will include weekly UAs and group therapy and I’m sure one on one with a Drug and Alcohol counselor. Also you said you have your own vices and I think you might want to address those as well. Listen to your heart and your gut and remember addicts will go to any length to feed the addiction. It’s not you or anyone else’s fault anymore than any other incurable disease it needs to be treated constantly. I hope that they are not using but I still think that if he’s even considered using he’s really at risk and I’ll say it plain. People that relapse on fentanyl are at huge risk of overdose and also of trading that addiction for different addictions. Lastly ask them to do weekly UA it shouldn’t be a problem if they aren’t using.",1698832528.0
k7bptvu,"Yeah I was worried when I started it but there were no problems, helped my life so much, although it did make me wonder if maybe if I had my ADHD treated sooner I would never have done drugs in the first place, but I know that's probably not true. I've gone back on Vyvanse now and have no desire to abuse it or get MORE focused. I don't know why. I think my brain just recognised the Ritalin from before, if that makes sense. Neither one of them makes me feel high, and the Ritalin wasn't even that effective for my ADHD, but in retrospect it also had the added effect of separating me from my emotions a bit. Yeah I almost relapsed ""properly"" after this came out and it freaked me out, so now I'm in a state of acceptance of what happened and gratitude that a higher powered intervention led to me coming clean about this behaviour, because honestly it was probably just a matter of time before my brain decided that drugs were the answer again.

I'm not that person any more, and even if messing around with Ritalin is the lamest relapse ever and still doesn't feel like one, that thinking and behaviour had come back.

k79te6x,"Thanks for sharing, clarity achieved! I can only share MY experience, strength, and hope......and I can offer NO ADVICE. I was responding to these statements in your original post- > > Every time something bothers me I immediately want to reach for heroin. I forgot how to cope with anything. > > Some days im just miserable and this can go on for weeks at a time. The anger and depression spikes are out of control. The anxiety is eating me up. I am very uncomfortable being around people, the only exception being my significant other. > > I came to the conclusion that I have no idea how to function as an adult. When I was first introduced to 12 step programs (AA, then NA) I too thought they were cults of religious zealots who were only interested in taking away the only thing that ever gave me any relief. Total abstinence? What a joke!! Why would anyone ever want to live that way?? Besides I didn't even believe it was possible. As for the whole Higher Power piece that really sounded like church to me and I wanted no part of it. You see I was really confused by the word rely/reliance. People (including myself) tend to believe the word means ""depend"". It doesn't. Dependence is about control (I was dependent- on certain drugs) and Reliance is about trust (I trusted no persons therefore I had nobody/nothing to rely upon). I had to ask myself the question.... Am I willing to be controlled by an HP? Or, am I willing to trust in an HP? Big difference!!!! It was suggested to me to look at the ""HP relationship"" like it was a GPS instead, it made it way easier to understand it. Today, I use an HP much in the same way I use a GPS. I tell it where I want to go and ""let"" it show me the best way. I didn't always... when I first started using it (both the GPS and the HP!!!) I didn't trust it and often thought I knew a faster/easier way to get where I wanted to go. Eventually I started going places that were new to me and I had to ""take a leap of faith"" that the GPS knew the best way. Lo and behold I began to get to all the new places effortlessly and all I had to do was ""trust"" it. In simple terms, NA gave me the freedom to believe in whatever I chose to believe in. I now believe the true power lies in the physical act of believing; Not what you actually choose to believe in. Now you may run into some people (I mean most), they seem to be so unsure about their personal beliefs that they instinctively try to require you to believe as they do, as if it is all a giant Ponzi scheme, and they have to convince you to believe or the whole thing comes crashing down. Be kind to them, their beliefs aren't as strong as yours. Feel free to tell them to Fuck Off, but do it in a loving and caring way!!!! Fortunately the people who came before us understood this and carefully worded the steps so that we could take them free of the dogma of conventional religions. Most religions you have to be born into, (Muslim, Judaism, Catholicism, etc.)... Don't get me started with Christianity..... I'm five years old, and you're gonna tell me somebody is already dead because I'm a sinner??? Get the fuck out of here. You have been given the rare and unique opportunity to redefine all the meaning in your life. The 12 steps can help you do just that. I personally did not like the word addict when I first discovered NA. I preferred Dope Fiend, or Crackhead (yes some are sicker than others) and I refused to identify as an addict. I proudly made ""clean from"" statements as if my problem was a particular substance and not the result of the disease of addiction. I also thought so long as I avoided one substance I was able to use other substances ""successfully or as directed"" and still be ""clean"". No matter what, I could not get behind the concept of total abstinence from all mind and mood altering drugs. After attending a few meetings and with ample encouragement from the Old-timers I became interested in knowing why NA was structured the way it is. I wanted to know why we used the term addiction and not chemically-dependent, or one of the other treatment community buzzwords. I was directed to read What is addiction? _HYPERLINK_ From that I gleaned the nature of addiction, as the term was being used in NA, to be a disease made manifest through an obsession and compulsion around using drugs. An obsession can best be described as an idea or thought that continually preoccupies or intrudes on a person's mind. Compulsion is an irresistible urge to behave in a certain way, especially against one's conscious wishes. In most 12-step programs, especially in NA, it is taught that the best way to avoid obsession is to not take that first drug. They go on to say that one is too many and a thousand never enough. If you are in fact an addict you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Through participating fully in the fellowship of NA I learned that the disease of addiction is a two-fold disease, an allergy of the body, and an obsession of the mind, the allergy expressed through my inability to control my drug use once having taken the first one, and the obsession being expressed by my inability to think about anything else but using drugs whether I had any drugs or not. I said before- The struggle ends when surrender begins. We can't struggle and surrender at the same time. We must choose one, or the other. Going back and forth is exhausting and fruitless. That one statement brought it all home for me. That and I also heard someone say, ""If I keep doing what I always did, I'm going to get what I always got."" Since I no longer wanted what I was always getting, something had to change. Problem was, I had no idea how to surrender. Once again the Old-timers came through and told the following: The process of surrender is the end result of working double overtime to find a solution that does not require giving up drugs completely. It is difficult to accept that drugs are the problem when we have not been able to find peace and serenity by any other means. When we make the decision to surrender, we get relief from the pain of making our own decisions. Surrender is positive for us because we find hope. Once we have surrendered, we open opportunities for other addicts to help us with our problems. Without understanding why, we get a sponsor, attend meetings and follow suggestions. We need to become willing to do anything to stay clean. Willingness is essential because we have to give our permission before change can occur. We must set aside our old thinking to open ourselves to new alternatives. The choice is up to us to change. Without our willingness, we never get to make the choice and remain tied up in many of our past limitations, illusions and habits. Once we become willing to put down the conviction that total abstinence is impossible and surrender to the fact that we are just like everyone else in NA then we can move forward with our commitment to staying clean. Once we surrender and become willing to do whatever is necessary to become abstinent, we need to stay committed to the process in order to not go back to the way of life we once knew. We need to make a commitment to a home group and stay clean no matter what. A commitment to a sponsor is also very important to this new way of life for we can not do this alone!!! There is no substitute for surrender. This may be very uncomfortable but we do it anyway because we know in our heart of hearts that this is the only way. Faith comes after this way of life becomes a reality. It comes to some quickly and to others slowly. If we are still clinging to the idea that we can use drugs, this way of life can not come at all. Remember these three things: The cornerstone of the NA program is total abstinence. There is no substitute for surrender. Recovery is a complete change of everything we do, everything we think.

k76gwzi,"I hope you keep feeling over it too. I am well acquainted with that fear-- when you feel solid in yr decision to quit but are so afraid yr mind and body might betray you in the future. I hate that feeling. Back in my AA days, I wrote a list of reasons not to drink. That helped as a reminder, to some extent. There's a tool, I think it's from SMART Recovery, called urge surfing, that I have not had good luck with but many do. Ooof I feel you on the sleep issues! Valerian root capsules have been the best support I've found. I also take magnesium glycinate and l-theanine but I'm not sure if they do anything. Speaking of supplements, L-tyrosine is supposed to help with dopamine production, so I used that when I was quitting. NAC is supposed to help with addictive behaviors. I've been taking it and I think it makes a difference! I'm on Naltrexone for alcohol use, which is also being explored for other compulsive behaviors, so I consider that and the NAC as important things in my toolbox. It's rad that you fixed yr living situation-- that is one of the hardest triggers to overcome. I was using for about 5 years. First twoish years were 1-2 weekends a month, then a year or two of daily use, then slowed back down to 1-2 times a month for the last yearish. For a long time I thought I had it under control, and I guess I kinda did-- I ran my own business well, volunteered in my community, handled my responsibilities, etc. But it just depleted the shit out of me. I was so stressed out and overwhelmed all the time. Being in constant fight or flight mode really did a number on my body and my mood.",1698719584.0

k76czxx,"I was confused by the wording of the steps because it used terms that I had already decided were ""religious"" or that were common to the church. Luckily I found a person who was able to show me the ""original 13 steps of NA"" and it opened my eyes to a new way of thinking about the steps...... Here's an exchange from about a year or so ago in which certain questions were asked and answered. It may be of some use to you today. > I am a teacher, which everyone says makes recovery harder I have never heard this.... anywhere. The only thing that makes recovery harder is unwillingness to surrender. It's impossible to surrender and struggle at the same time. If you're struggling try a little surrender. > The whole reason we are not supposed to ask people for help is so that we have to find a higher power. That never made sense to me. This is so not what it means to find an HP. Actually an HP works through people so in order to have a relationship with an HP one must have other people in their lives. I'm going to give you the original 13 steps of NA (from the 1940's before we modeled the fellowship after AA) at the end of this message. God/HP only appears in step 13. > Years ago someone told me I should get number so I went around giving out mine hoping to get some in return. Can you spot the contradiction here? You were told to get..... not to give and hope. > I went to rehab and came out with so much shame Guilt is ""I did something wrong"" and shame is ""I am wrong"". You are not wrong, you may have done bad things, but you are not wrong. You were born, whole, perfect, and complete. Somewhere along the way you were corrupted by drugs, your perception was warped. The steps help you to ""clean your glasses"" so you can see things free of distortion. > The program is such a lonely path and that does not suit me. I was in a halfway house many years ago and on every wall, in every direction you could look, there was a sign that read, ""WHY ARE YOU HERE?"". Until I knew the answer I was full of doubt/contradiction. Once I accepted my being an addict I never had to ask myself that question again. You may benefit from looking at the ultra old-school steps..... from the 1940's before NA actually became what it is to day.... Here they are, they're kinda neat I think... In the lead up to forming NA as we know it today, the very first meetings were actually held with the help of The Salvation Army. Early NA pioneers adapted the SA's 7-steps, adding to them to create the 13-steps. I suspect this was to help differentiate NA from the existing AA meetings. Here's Greg sharing the 13 steps- Original 13 steps-listen to 10:10 _HYPERLINK_ . 13 STEPS OF NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS 01 Admit the use of narcotics made my life more tolerable, but the drug had become an undesirable power over my life. 02 Came to realize that to face life without drugs I must develop an inner strength. 03 Made a decision to face the suffering of withdrawal. 04 Learned to accept my fears without drugs. 05 Find someone who has progressed this far & is able to assist me. 06 Admit to him the nature & depth of my addiction. 07 Realize the seriousness of my shortcomings as I know them & accept responsibility for facing them. 08 Admit before a group of N.A. members these same shortcomings & explain how I am trying to overcome them. 09 List, for my own understanding, all the persons I have hurt. 10 Take a daily inventory of my actions & admit to myself those which are contrary to good conscience. 11 Realize that to maintain freedom from drugs I must share with others the experience from which I have benefited. 12 Determine a purpose in my life & try with all the spiritual & physical power within me to move towards this fulfillment. 13 GOD HELP ME !

k72cwyb,"They have a Drug Addicts Anonymous that’s basically Addicts Anonymous. I’ve never been. The precursor to NA were program called Addicts Anonymous, they had some drama with leadership and it fell by the wayside. The reason the A’s do it is for identification. They want the person to come into the room and identify with the shares and things said and people there so they feel like they’re in the right place. If I’m an alcoholic and I go to AA and all I hear is people talking about heroin and drug addiction, I might not feel like I belong there when I did come to Alcoholics Anonymous for alcoholism. That’s why they booted all the drug addicts in the 40s and NA eventually happened. Thanks Bill. With NA they cover all drugs, consider alcohol a drug and make no differentiation between drugs (prescribed drugs taken as prescribed excluded). It’s so Addict 1 with Addiction A doesn’t come in and hears only Addict 2 sharing about Addiction B then thinks, “Well, I don’t have a Addiction B problem, I don’t belong here, I’m never coming back.” They do the disease model in totality and try to provide identification on the level of apparent feelings and experiences rather than particular substances with the intention of any drug addict being able to walk in and identify. The downside of that is people come in and are like, “Why is nobody talking about specific drugs or drugs in general? I am here because of this or these drugs, I would like to talk about these drugs. Why is the chair mean mugging me because I said a drug’s name? Why did a 70 year old man have a minor stroke when I identified as a heroin addict or alcoholic?” Because it’s twelve steps and there’s obnoxious amounts of decorum. Anyway, here’s all of or most of the recovery programs and community things omitting the A’s everyone knows about it you’re looking for a new venue or anyone else reading. They are all splendid and anything that isn’t the A’s tends to be much less substance specific. As Nlarko mentioned, SMART is great and tends to jive with those who don’t enjoy the A’s.

k71shnh,"You’re in good company. “Terminal uniqueness”. The feeling that a person’s experiences in addiction and whatever happened before and during it are so different from anyone else’s that they can’t identify in recovery environments from rehab to programs. It’s part of the addiction, it wants you to feel alone and like there’s no solution specifically catered to you. Because there isn’t one and there never will be one. That’s the terminal part, a “Unique Addict” is a dead addict because no help or solution will be the right one. That’s why they encourage really trying to focus on the similarities in recovery settings and not the differences. The least important aspect of addiction is usually what substances you used because it all takes us to the same places. Some do require substance specific environments to identify and feel a part of, hence AA and CMA and CA, etc but after the initial “Holy shit, I’m exactly like everyone here” it doesn’t matter so much what program or process you’re in. An addict can relate to the symptoms in any of them, the feelings part and vice-related experiences might take a person to a specific fellowship or program. The important thing is you find some people and a solution and if it’s not perfect, you hammer your ass into whatever shape fits into the hole and hope it works. The alternatives aren’t great. I can go to any recovery meeting or setting and know I’m with a bunch of my degenerate malcontent overgrown child fellow addicts. It’s nice. I don’t always like being there and I don’t always feel a part of but I know I require these people and places if I don’t want to die a using addict.

Is really hard to stop enabling but you need to learn that this is a family disease and you need to change by healing too if you want to help her.

I have lived with addicts, am an addict myself, and have worked for facilities that help and treat addicts. Way too many addicts do not get the help they need b/c of arguments about the nature of addiction, both internally with the addict, and, in a broader sense, within the academic community. I have seen addicts denied treatment for this very reason: ""They aren't addicted. They have no genetic predisposition/they are not old enough/they are too old/their drug of choice isn't addictive/they don't use that much etc. etc. I have seen this far too many times to count, just as I have then seen many of those who were turned away dead from overdose a short time later.

k6zv05y," i think the real issue is that our collective understanding of 'addiction' doesn't necessarily hold up to emerging data/research about drug use/ substance abuse disorder. and therefore existing treatment models are severely underserving a vulnerable population. roughly 80% of residential treatment centers, in the US, are based on the minnesota model which holds that addiction is a disease that's best treated with medical detox, traditional talk therapy, and exposure to 12 step programs. and while anonymous 12 step programs absolutely help some people they're not necessarily the best or only answer. if substance use disorder qualifies as a medical condition (i believe that it does) then it makes sense that treatment for it should primarily be medical and not necessarily spiritual or moral. and this is not a knock on twelve step programs. they work for some people and folks should do whatever works best for them. but funneling such a large, diverse cohort of people into such a narrow range of treatment hasn't yet worked, so maybe it's time to look to other areas.",1698609742.0

Rest, but get of bed at the same time whether you sleep or not. Spend at least 15 minutes outside in the morning (before noon). This helps circadian rhythm. Have a smoothie or a salad. Changing your whole diet is too much but adding a few fruits or veg (in a pleasant way) makes your body happier. Look for a new hobby. Recovery takes a little time.

That being said, once you get through the initial stages of being clean and sober, there's a lot less of stare change needed because you generally feel better overall.

k6m7nts,"It's a wild ride and it is scary not having the answer. The best thing to relieve anxiety is either feeling like there isn't a problem or that we are in complete control of it. The reality is that there is so much about life where either of those two solutions apply. Medication, drugs and alcohol can offer a feeling of a problem not existing but it's only temporary. Anyone in recovery will tell that that even that temporary solution stops working in time. Xanax usually isn't the answer. It's a short acting benzo that has it's uses for immediate and serious panic attacks. It's certainly applicable in some situations but is rarely offers a long term solution. Sometimes it's just necessary but probably isn't ideal. Even for someone suffering from high levels of anxiety a benzo with a longer half-life is often a better option. Still not the best as it's generally a ""band-aid"". I say this as someone who both used a variety of benzos as prescribed and then later abused the hell out of. Someone who is almost 4 years clean from them and still deals with many of the symptoms you described above. I took lamictal for awhile and it helped. After awhile I was slowly feeling more depressed and apathetic. I talked to my doctor about it a lot and she suggested I try a low dose of zoloft and could stop taking the lamictal as it might not be helping much. Being in recovery I'm a little hesitant to be taking either a bunch of different meds or a lot of any one. So far, I've seen some improvement with 50mg of zoloft a day and no lamictal. This has been maybe two months. I cannot stress enough however that the most important thing for me in sobriety has been therapy. I started with a therapist a few months ago. It was slow going at first and a little frustrating at times. I stuck with it though and am beginning to see how it's helping in a very ""real"" way. As in, catching myself literally experiencing life and situations in new perspectives. Almost as if it was having a ""physical"" effect akin to that I sought in drugs and alcohol. I'm not a doctor but things like a lack of motivation, anxiety, brain fog/zaps all align with both benzo use and withdrawal. What I'm getting at is that just stopping a medication will stop the side effects. It doesn't mean it's a comprehensive answer however. The real solution to your answer might be making peace with not always having one. Navigating this is a challenge but isn't always a difficult one. Sometimes it is exciting or even fun. Once I stopped looking for a comprehensive solution in drugs/alcohol or medication of any sort I opened the door to learning so much about myself. I need help though, I can't do it alone. Maybe I could actually but I don't want to. The opportunities offered by being wrong can be just as rewarding as those offered by being right. I dunno if this helps at all.

k6javqz,"Yeah, sleep is going to be tough. Keeping your room cold, if you can, and having a few blankets of different weights, so you can switch between covering yourself, when you’ve got chills, and stripping down to either just a light sheet, or no blanket, when you feel too hot, can be helpful. Night sweats will happen for a while, so be prepared to wash your sheets often. But, I am so impressed that you are getting through it! Good for you, dude. You’re doing so well and it’ll definitely be worth it in the end. Keep it up! Oh, taking long showers does help, too. Stay plenty hydrated, also. It’ll be annoying because you’re going to have to pee every three seconds— more than the withdrawal is already making you— but it will help your body. Take over-the-counter medication (anti nausea and anti diarrheal) for your stomach to help with the upset. A lot of people take Loperamide and Pepto-Bismol. Candy also helps— like Jolly Ranchers, sour gummy worms, Nerds, Skittles, Jelly Beans, Starbursts, etc. So, whatever your favorite candy is, indulge (although chocolate is not as helpful as sugary candies). Eat small/light, easy-to-digest meals that won’t make you feel as sick, and will still nourish your body. Cereal, like, say, Honey Nut Cheerios, is good. If you can, take a multi-vitamin, too. If you have access to a doctor, non-narcotic medications like clonidine, gabapentin, robaxin and trazadone can help you get through. They’re called “comfort meds.” Anyway, like I said, you’re doing awesome! Really phenomenal job! Each day, it will get a little better. You absolutely made the right decision and I’m so proud of you!

k6ddvnl,"23M. I was very quiet and awkward as a young man, still am sometimes if I am in a depressed mood. What has helped is what I think of as various ""social bootcamps"" throughout my life. The first was at age 14 when I ""decided"" to be funny. I know that sounds weird and it obviously led to a lot of cringe due to trial and error but today I crack jokes and people seem to like it. That came with time I guess. The next was at age 18 when I went to work at a summer camp. Being a counselor was different from being a camper because it was our actual responsibility to hype people up and keep the fun going. There were also a lot more opportunities for socializing with women. However, this period was completely booze-fueled for me and I was still very quiet and depressed without alcohol. Eventually, I found my way into AA, especially young people's meetings. I felt like an outsider for a long time but what I learned through these bootcamps is that, if you just show up around people long enough, the friendship will come. So I tried to be consistent with my presence. Now I have the confidence to talk to these people, and they always seem happy to see me. If AA is not your jam I strongly suggest getting around some kind of recovery group, but I know that can be tough if your recovery doesn't look like what they officially (or unofficially) ""stand for."" But being around people who are willing to share honestly has been the number one thing for me, in staying sober and also in forming connections with people. After sharing deep and possibly fucked up shit in the meeting it's easier to go outside and joke around about more normal topics, even with near-strangers. Anyway, sorry for the long ramble but best of luck to you! These things come with time.",1698225879.0

k6d8rnr,Go to the hospital. They would refer for sure. They can also refer to in and out patient (seems it would be better to do inpatient so the care at night doesn’t still fall on you). I know that if they admit to wanting to commit suicide they will be held. I’m not sure if they know this and don’t mention it. I went to hospital after being physically assaulted and was so experiencing abuse at home and after years of this I was indeed wanting to kill myself. I was found crying and screaming in the hospital parking lot having a breakdown after going into shock about what was happening. Anyways they did a psych assessment and had me sign papers and I literally left the hospital in the middle of the night and they kept calling and calling but I was so scared I went all the way home. Anyways I’m not sure if this person wants help. I wish I I had help when I stopped cold turkey smoking. Vaping. Marijuana. Doing cocaine daily. Xanax. Muscle relaxers. The migraines increase alone were unbearable. The throwing up. The blood pressure dropping and rising. The fever. The nausea. The cramps. Endured this while also being abused so literally on my own and also having to clean and cook for him and being yelled at and pushed and shoved while already shaking and going into shock.

k6cbseq,"If it’s alcohol/meth I would bring them to detox, there they will do an assessment and find them a treatment center that takes their insurance, they have case managers for that. In Minnesota the detox/treatment center will help get you on state insurance if you’re not already on it, I am not sure how it works in other states. If opiates are their drug of choice call treatment centers directly. If they are an IV drug user or pregnant they will get priority. Detox is particularly important because they will asses the suicidal ideation aspect. Don’t listen to the person about not going to the ER, it’s not that simple.

And says that it's not like I've wasted my recovery, and that my honesty and experience can help others. To be honest it is a bit of a relief. My life kind of fucked out a bit and I couldn't understand why because I was ""clean"". It's the behaviour and thinking around it which is starting to make it really clear that I relapsed.

k67nt01,"Well, Ritalin is a mental health medication for an executive function disorder, ADHD. You mentioned you had a sponsor so I’m assuming you’re in NA or AA. If you’re in AA, drugs are an outside issue, read this post to your sponsor and see what your sponsor tells you. If you’re in NA, this is the official Narcotics Anonymous IP on Mental Health in Recovery. _HYPERLINK_ From said IP - “We may be advised at some point in our recovery to take medications to treat our mental health condition. Medications are to be taken as prescribed by an informed healthcare professional; we do not self-medicate. Many of us have found it wise to inform our sponsors and a few friends in our support network that we are taking medication. This action helps us to be accountable and allows others we trust to be our “eyes and ears. Many of us have heard, either individually or in meetings, that members taking medication are not clean. However, some mental health medications are prescribed to help manage symptoms that interfere with leading a healthy, productive, drug-free lifestyle. Members who take mental health medication as prescribed by a healthcare professional are considered clean.” You were prescribed Ritalin by a medical professional at a particular dose to treat ADHD. You then decided to take more than what was prescribed to you of an addictive controlled substance for something other than it’s intended purpose - Treating ADHD - To get through the day so you could work at night. That has nothing to do with ADHD, that’s using Ritalin the same way a person would use cocaine or meth. This was during a period of time you were fighting the constant urge to not abuse the Ritalin you had been prescribed for ADHD to get high. You took more than what was prescribed which would be self-medicating at best - Which is specifically outlined as something we don’t do in the NA IP - And abuse of the drug at worse, which is what you really did as you took it for purposes it wasn’t prescribed to you for in amounts over what was prescribed. Given the information above, do you feel like you’re still clean or do you believe you relapsed?",1698124821.0

k64sjcn,"I don’t have personal experience with high calorie foods triggering me but I’ll try to draw a comparison with a substance I do struggle with simply because the chemical reaction in the brain is identical no matter what the substance is. First off, it’s awesome that you’re thinking ahead and planning for these triggers and how to avoid them. Noticing that you react a certain way and feel a certain way when tempted with sugary high calorie foods shows a level of self awareness (this is key). Don’t take the small actions you take to overcome your addiction for granted, they should be celebrated. Celebrating the “small wins” are key for reprogramming your brains process in distributing dopamine as a reward for healthier actions. Also, question the “why” behind the relief your DOC gives you. I ask myself all the time when I’m tempted “why exactly am I tempted to do this? Am I anxious? Ami bored? Am I stressed? Which once you’re super aware of how you feel and react to your DOC (what problem it’s solving for you) it can help you feel a bit more in control over it and in turn do something different. And knowing it’s a predictable process that’s normal with anything that releases a lot of dopamine can also help you realize there’s ways to overcome your thoughts (atleast it’s helped me). But you have to have a good understanding of what’s happening in your brain and be super aware of your emotions related to your DOC. So, with that said, I’ll compare it to alcohol with me. Since I’ve been in recovery I (like you mentioned) keep my DOC out of house and do what I can to avoid it at all costs. My DOC was opiates and meth but alcohol lowers my decision making ability which leads to me using my doc. It compares a little easier to your DOC. But there are situations where I can’t avoid alcohol. Family functions like your situation… having a plan helps immensely. I actually picture how I’ll handle a situation beforehand. Recent studies show visualizing an outcome literally doubles the likelihood you’ll actually do what you’ve visualized. If people won’t let up ill just leave the situation. This is totally fine when you’re trying to learn dif coping skills so don’t let anyone make you feel bad about leaving a situation. It’s about YOUR health not THEIR feelings (and anyone who wants you to be healthier will understand and won’t judge you for it) I’ll try to retrain my brain to think “I’ll get more of a reward for not drinking than I will for drinking” I’ll reward myself for standing my ground and saying no thanks which associates the dopamine release with refraining from my doc, not reinforcing its use. It was a long process that took a lot of reprogramming and a lot of inner work on acknowledging that my substance did solve my problems but only short term and in a self destructive manner. I had to now replace the dopamine release with something healthier. Don’t be discouraged if this doesn’t happen over night, it didn’t take a day or 1 situation for your brain to associate food with a pleasurable feeling, and it’ll take prob double the effort to break it and replace it with something else. I know this was long and may be all over the place but I hope it helps even a little. Remember “neurons that fire together, wire together” so if you associate refraining from your DOC with a sense of personal empowerment, your brain will respond with dopamine release and creating new pathways that repel substance use and attract healthier options and refraining from using. Every time you practice “saying no” and rewarding yourself mentally, the easier it’ll become. If you fall short of your intention be easy with yourself and just learn what went wrong. Really pick apart what your thoughts were and what you could do different next time. I really hope this was easy to follow and made sense 🫶🏼 I can really empathize with just how difficult this process is and I’ve failed more times than I can count. But you just keep learning and don’t give up, you’ll get there with practice and understanding of the process and yourself.

k63v9jv,"I felt the same way, it felt like I’d never be as happy without drugs in my life to “enhance” it. This is totally normal and the definition of what happens to our brain in addiction. We’ve basically conditioned/tricked our brains into only getting that dopamine hit when we use drugs or think about/plan on how to get them. Our sensitivity to other things that could bring us happiness is diminished. Once detoxed for 30/60 days your dopamine receptors will start to become sensitive to other things again. There’s ways to promote healing and creation of new pathways that addiction hijacked. New associations and memories that don’t involve drugs is key. I had to start creating new ways to experience happiness (building relationships, exercise, learning/education). I’ve always had a tendency to want to experience things intensely (which is what drew me to drugs). Once I realized and accepted that I needed to feel things intensely I started to replace the intense feeling of drugs and dive into other intense experiences (healthier ones). Building intense relationships that included deep understanding honesty and communication. A lot of people I’ve talked to in addiction and recovery really feel a deep yearning to connect with others. Superficial connection and interactions do nothing for me. I was surprised to find out that mostly everyone feels this need regardless if they’ve had issues with substances. This is where I started. I also can be a bit obsessive so once I understood and accepted that’s how I’m wired I turned that energy towards obsessively learning about and helping others overcome addiction. I started obsessively learning about the neuroscience and psychology of addiction. I then took my knowledge and started thinking about how to use this to help others. This was also key, feeling like you have a purpose and doing something you’re good at. Hope this made sense and helped somewhat. Hang in there, I struggled with addiction for 17ish years and NEVER thought I’d break free, there was a point where I accepted that my family would eventually bury me as a result of drugs. I still have days that are hard but I just keep remembering that my mind will always get me if I don’t have a good understanding and self awareness to harness it towards creating.

k60j9w1,"The dude talked good informations about endorphins.

What I really rely on is the dopamine, the feeling of accomplishment and discipline can give me focus and fill the void temporarily, till the next day when I start to workout again and I start to feel like myself again.... like calisthenics, where you focus on skills and muscle growth control and mobility. Calisthenics is really changing my life. ...

k5yg73m,"Yes and no... Depends I suppose. From personal experience, I was taking upwards of 200mg of diazepam per day. Long story short, I was off benzos completely after about 30 days.

After the 30 day fiasco, about 30 days after that, (60 days in) I was starting to come back down to earth a little bit. I was able to get back to driving. And everyday gets a tiny bit better. But, there are certain things that still linger from my benzo usage. And I've been off benzos for about 5+ years.. Sleeping patterns are still not right.. I can be very animated and talkative in my sleep. That has never went away. I am frightened more easily than I used to be. The list goes on... There might be lingering side effects for years yes.. Depends on how long you were on them and what dosages. If you been taking them for 10+ years, you're probably going to feel off for that long at least. I was only on them for a little over 2 years. And I'm still not 100% back to normal.. I'd say im about 90% back to normal.. I hope this helps.. I feel very strongly about this subject, because I've been through this..

k5xelzi,"Yes. It was painful for me just to exist in early recovery. I remember slogging through days weeks and months feeling I had nothing to look forward to in life. At some point I got bored of being on my phone/tv/video games and I started going on walks around the apartments I lived in. I started doing 1 lap , then 2 then 3 and then I started walking in the morning too. 3 laps was 3.6 miles so I was taking up a good amount of time and getting in some good exercise. I started looking forward to these walks. When I got a car I would drive around all over the place to try out new hiking trails. First I would do 3 or 4 miles, then 8, 10, and eventually a 12-mile hike. These hikes are all day affairs for the most part, driving an hour or more hiking half the day and then I try out a restaurant nearby for lunch/dinner. Or any attractions the town might have. I started looking forward to these weekly excursions. I also started meditating, 2-3 times a day for 10 minutes at a time. I would use guided meditations at first but now I just play something ambient or sound bowls. It took me a while for it to have an effect but after getting in the regular habit of it I’m able to feel a sense of peace throughout my day. Sometimes I will pray during these, for my friends and family and everyone in this world. I thank the universe for providing me this body and this world to exist in, even when it seems empty to me. I started combining the meditation and prayer with yoga and tai chi and the calming effects have been increased exponentially. It feels like I’ve tapped into some kind of universal power source. I start each day reminding myself of how absolutely bonkers the universe and reality are and telling myself I’m not gonna do drugs today. I started going to a Spiritualist church on Sundays. I sit and listen. Sometimes I go up to the Healers for laying on of hands. I meditate during the Healing. I say the prayers and I listen to the sermon. I wait and sometimes If I’m lucky I get a reading from a Medium. Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes I don’t understand, but it’s always interesting and gives me something to think about. I stay after for cake and coffee and chat for a bit with the friends I’ve made there. They are all very welcoming and open-minded if not a bit eccentric. I have friends and a sponsor who are all sober, I met them through the 12-Step rooms. I have friends who are not sober but I rarely see them. Me and my sponsor meet and have deep insightful conversations about life. Not just drugs and addiction, in fact we rarely even speak about either unless it’s relevant. My sponsor genuinely cares about my well-being and I can talk to him about anything. I couldn’t tell you exactly when all the pieces came together, one day things just started noticeably improving. Getting full time employment was a huge help but it was all the moving parts working in unison that kept me moving forward mentally. Pick out some cool stuff you wanna try. They have so much on YouTube. Just do it for 5-10 minutes at a time to start. But do it daily. It’s all about what you do EACH DAY. I wake up. Read my daily message / meditation from AA/NA (available free online or on the apps). I do a 15 minute “yoga in bed” video. I read a daily meditation from a book I have. I sit in quiet or with ambient music playing and meditate for 10-15 minutes. When I open my eyes it’s like I’m waking up again, only for REAL this time. At this point I shake off any funk I may have for the day. Brush teeth wash face moisturize get changed etc… Then I read recovery subreddits and respond to posts like these until I have to leave. At work I try to have fun. I am a team member at chick fil a. I was a district manager before I lost my job during active addiction, I made 93k a year. Now I make $17.25/hour. I make jokes and smile with everyone. I am not stressed by the entry level position. I focus on my work. I’m friendly with the customers , sometimes they are friendly back. Sometimes they have dogs in their cars. Sometimes they let me pet their dogs ! I got to hold a kitten last week and yesterday I met a puppy named Angel who was so tiny and trembling but started to lick me. It was amazing. Sometimes things are busy and my coworkers are stressed out, I don’t let this bother me. I focus on each moment and making the most of it at work. I don’t look at the clock, I don’t like how it makes me feel when I try to think about time. My work says I am doing well and want to pay me more to manage things. I decline. I’d love the money but it’s not worth the stress. I am making just enough to pay for gas, insurance, and rent. I mostly eat at work where it’s free. I have what I need. Work asks me to train new employees I agree and am given a raise and promotion. They are usually young people, in high school and college. I love to hear about their lives, they are all doing so well. Sometimes they tell me about the bad things in their lives. Sometimes these things are awful and tragic. I listen to them. I come home. I go for a 3.5 mile walk down to the river from the sober house I live at now. Sometimes the people I live with are about in the common area. They are all friendly and we greet each other and ask about each other’s days. I shower and get changed. I take my medication. I put on relaxing music and do tai chi and yoga forms for 20 minutes.

k5tos9h,"Yeah because you were doing “better” before sobriety. You were artificially keeping the chemical levels in your brain balanced. Of course you feel worse going through withdrawal than you did while still getting your fix. I don’t mean to be patronizing, but it is funny how we can totally lose all perspective on the “obvious” things when using every day becomes the new normal for us. Like saying “I know it’s not normal to feel like I’m dying while withdrawing from an 8 year daily benzo addiction.” Good news! Your DOC (and your old one, alcohol) are the only two drugs whose withdrawals can kill you all by themselves. So you should feel like you’re dying, because you are! 👍 So if you wanted validation that you’re not the only person in the world who has ever felt like they’re going through withdrawals while you’re going through withdrawals, luckily for you none of what you’re experiencing is unique. Lol im sorry again for the sarcasm, but seriously just Google “benzo withdrawal symptoms” and you’ll see everything you described here and you will read timelines of how long the short-term and PAWS will last and what that means. As for whether it’s worth it to feel like shit for longer than you wanted to and then get better or keep living/dying on benzos, that’s ultimately up to you and what you want out of life 🤷🏻‍♂️ I can guarantee you though, the only way it will ever get better eventually is if you stop right the fuck now. Don’t prolong this shit by going back now. Just Google every symptom you see for benzo withdrawal followed by the word “help” or “treatment” and you will see thousands of results for dealing with the anhedonia, the insomnia, the suicidal thoughts, the anxiety, the restless legs, the sleeping med side effects, etc. It’s all there.",1697892345.0

k5sx3gl,"I hurt my back trying to dig a pond in my back yard, I felt the crack and the shooting pain in my back and down my leg and could barely stand. I made an appt with my family doc to get a referral to a back surgeon. She didn’t feel it was necessary and put me on lortabs. 1 every 4 hours or as necessary. Soon I was flying through the script and started hitting other docs and the ER doctor shopping and using different pharmacies to fill them. The pain just got worse and soon I was switched to Oxys and enjoyed that generation. They just kept upping my script, it was nothing for me to take 40 or so a day along with benzos and muscle relaxers. My doc had me going to a pain clinic as well who added more pills. My tolerance was insane. Finally a ER doc caught on to me and I got red flagged in their system and before I knew it every doctor had cut me off. The. I began buying them on the streets. The pain was real and I finally realized I had a problem. I went to the surgeons office, and even though they said I couldn’t see him without a referral I refused to leave. He did end up seeing me, did some X-rays and two days later I was in surgery for two shattered discs L4, 5. Also degenerative disc disorder. He gave me a small script after and I knew I was finished. I turned to alcohol to fill the gap. I still bought pills on the street but they were never enough. At 40 years old I had a heart attack. It still wasn’t my wake up call. I went til 47 consuming crazy amounts of alcohol and pills and began my suicide attempts. My family disowned me, even my daughter. I finally got help and went to rehab.

k5s2gj0,You’re doing great tho brother. You really are. You are just in the eye of the storm and it’s going to be that way for a bit. But just don’t give up. I’m not a doctor but man I just think our brains don’t fully kick into recovery mode until that shit is out the system. And that’s the most difficult part bc it feels awful. I have addiction issues too and the Baclofen was not a problem. It was a life saver. Baclofen is a very old and safe drug that they treat alcohol wd with. It acts on the same receptors as benzos. It wasn’t a silver bullet but it helped. Gabapentin also helped.,1697856122.0
k5s0qck,"No, it doesn’t last for years. It won’t. After the cessation of all benzos it may take a few weeks before you feel close to normal again. But it will not take years. I’ve been through 3 benzo wd after years on Klonopin. Gonna be honest it wasn’t fun, and the last bout took about 2 months for me to feel normal. It just takes time for the brain the heal and it’s not anything you can rush. But you will heal. I would start counting your recovery clock once the benzos are completely out of your system. A drug that helped me was Baclofen. I took pretty high doses but it helped me get some good naps. I also did martial arts to distract my brain. Congrats on your progress. Don’t believe that bullshit you read from some people. I’m not saying one’s brain isn’t affected in some ways for a while…but the acute wd which is the most uncomfortable part, will not last more than a few weeks. Best of luck to you.",1697855263.0
k5rt6vh,"Congrats on being clean for almost a year, that's amazing! I understand feeling like a loser/deserving the worst - you are not alone in that. But I'm thinking those are probably the underlying feelings/thoughts that led to the drug abuse in the first place. I don't think people get addicted to drugs for no reason - especially not when you can recognize that you used to feel better about yourself. You definitely do deserve to live - everyone makes mistakes. This is just a good chance to show yourself some love by taking care of your health the best you can. Maybe you can seek some counseling to deal with the self worth issues - it might help. My story: drugs and black-out alcohol binges were my form of entertainment from 14-20. I had a brief phase of cleaning up my life and became a personal fitness trainer about 20 yrs old but I met a guy who smoked oxy there and unfortunately I decided to try that. Got hooked from day 1. All drugs and alcohol made me feel better/more comfortable in my skin/more free but oxy was by far the best substance I ever tried. Pills were crazy expensive so I ended up out of money and in rehab pretty quickly. Ended up meeting a guy from my town that did heroin and of course I wanted to try. And over the next 7 years I went to rehab twice, a halfway house, two DUIs with court programs, multiple stays at detoxes. Living in hotels for brief time. ODing frequently. Lost multiple jobs for nodding out at work. I was a fucking mess. Eventually I got tired of the shitty life style because I was always broke and sick. Got offered a job but had to go on methadone to make it work. Turns out the methadone really saved my life. Part of me regrets the methadone because it's literally just like taking opiates but you just don't get high - but I was still a zombie with no ambition or emotions. It was weird. Anyways I was on that for about 1.5 years or so...successfully tapered off...used a couple times on the program and decided never again. Now I've been clean almost 4 years. But I still struggle bad with similar thoghts to you and they are getting in my way of having a good life so I'm pretty depressed. Don't feel like using is a solution anymore though so hey I'm doing good in that regard. Never thought I'd quit honestly and now it's like I'm a whole different person.

k5n66ei,"No I should’ve clarified I had gotten off subs or been off them for nearly a decade. The last 5 years of which I struggled immensely with alcohol [&] relapses, and being on & off kratom til the last 2 years of that 5 being on kratom til I reached absurd daily dosage with very little in the way of relief & a high. I would literally wake up every night crawling out of my skin & have to re dose throughout the night. It was dumb of me but the way I used it wasn’t like 7 grams here then 7 there is was more like 10 grams in the AM then a Gatorade bottle mixed with kratom refilled and drank throughout the day, til maybe 3-4 I’d have kava then smoke weed & forget about the kratom til crawling out of my skin. Rinse repeat. I didn’t pay attention to the quantity because I was dumb & simply not measuring Honestly I don’t know. I needed to stop kratom. Different veins & / or different batches having different effects, plus the cost, and the total lack of any high and barely any relief from kratom at the end was hell that needed to stop. The withdrawals for me were unbearable. The depression & anxiety for months after quitting was unbearable. Like you I got high from the subs initially, so I was blown away when - from kratom alone at this point - my suboxone level out dose , ie what it took to stop kratom, was/is 4mg twice a day. The decade prior 2mg made me high as fuck and now 8mg total barely scratches the surface. Which may attest to kratoms power. I also realized when moving states and buying my kratom at different places, new local spots, that the kratom I’d been using was somehow of a different beast compared to what people were buying here. I was amazed at the glowing reviews for kratoms that did nothing but barely prevent withdrawal until shipment could arrive from my normal vendor. Anyways, my life became more manageable and it certainly has been nice not caring about redosing or if I’m gonna run out of anything or how much money I have, and nice no longer lying to myself pretending just cause it’s called kratom and is t as popular as other drugs doesn’t mean it’s not a real addiction. You’ve made it so far I say keep going. Add strenuous exercise and eat healthy. Don’t look back. You’re lucky to have a husband and family and support and life not in shambles. Look at it like you’re halfway to your brain getting back to normal. Join a kratom quitting sub and you’ll find tons of stories like yours and some like mine (ie people who had to go on bupe maintenance from kratom. I’ve learnt it doesn’t matter for me what the drug is, and sometimes it doesn’t even matter how much I like it, I’ll still do it to extremes. That black & white thinking is hard to eradicate.

k5mav8v,"Oh my god I feel a little less alone after reading this because I have felt the exact same way for years now. The first time I recall noticing it was in early 2016, which was the same year I started suboxone. Part of me feels like suboxone plays a roll in it, but that’s a topic for another time. Anyways, it was 2016 and the beginning of spring. It was a Saturday, and it was the first sunny, warm Saturday that we had after a long, cold winter. It was my day off & I didn’t have my daughter at the time so I slept the entire day… like til nearly 4:30pm. I woke up & started scrolling Instagram—and that’s when I realized I had missed what seemed to be a busy, beautiful day for everyone I know. My feed was full of pictures & happy memories of people out living their lives. I felt guilty for sleeping all day, but at the same time — I had no desire to go do anything. If I had been awake, I doubt I would have went outside anyways. I wasn’t always like this. I was a social butterfly who loved staying busy with plans. I know things change with age but this feels different. I don’t enjoy doing anything, at all. I dissociate and zone out to make it through the day. I have a 5yo daughter who requires me to be present and attentive, and I’m working on myself daily trying to get back to the old me. I’m doing a slow taper off subtext at the moment. I started taking Wellbutrin back in January, and that has actually helped. A lot. I guess I didn’t really provide any insight for you. I’ve never met anyone that feels the way I do. People in my life attribute it to my drug use and the fact that I was a tumultuous, abusive relationship with the father of my child for nearly 7yo which ended only bc he passed away. I would also attribute my feelings to that as well bc being a single mom is so hard and I cry often bc I don’t have anyone to share the daily tasks of what comes w raising a child.

Making mistakes is part of growing up and part of being human. It sounds like you have good character, your aversion to lie to those you love is a beautiful quality. Addiction has a way of spoiling even a persons character the longer it is allowed to drive the car of your life. If you are ready, take the plunge and start doing the work.

k5iuimk,"I only have experience starting an AA meeting, so I couldn't really speak to doing a more general unaffiliated general recovery support group. Starting an AA group is pretty simple, as all groups are autonomous and self supporting. Usually you get a group of people together who are in recovery who want to start a group. Maybe they feel that a certain sub-group or demographic isn't served by the current local meeting offerings. Maybe they feel they want a group that focuses on a certain aspect of recovery, or piece of literature, or approach to the literature, or newcomers, or young people, or LGBTQIA+ folks, etc. From there you come up with a primary purpose for your meeting that folks can agree on, and you come up with a breakdown of how the meeting will go. You write up that breakdown and agree on it as the founding members of that group. Then you pool your monetary resources to get enough on hand to pay initial rent and other expenses like coffee, literature, meeting supplies, etc. This number can vary greatly and other existing groups are often willing to help with extra supplies and literature they might have on hand to get you going. Then you need a space to have the meeting. So, you approach a place that has meeting space available, usually a church or some other kind of community center that allows for 12 step recovery meetings, and you ask about their availability. You pick a time that works for you and you pay them whatever their rent is for the space. For us, it was $20 a week for a space that holds about 80 people for 1 hour a week, plus setup/breakdown time and time for a monthly group business meeting. Our location also requested that we take out an insurance policy specifically for our meeting in the unlikely event that someone is injured directly as a cause of our meeting, or there is property damage to their location as a direct result of our meeting. This isn't a universal thing that all meeting locations require, but it is for us. Costs us about $250 a year, paid annually every autumn. From there we contacted our local area AA intergroup and figured out how to get our meeting listed on the official local meeting lists so folks could find us. We also made announcements at other area meetings that a new meeting was starting and could use support. And from there, you have the meetings and continue to ask people to spread the word until hopefully enough people show up weekly to sustain the meeting going forward. The idea is that enough people continually show up so that no one person, or small group of people, are ultimately responsible for keeping it going. It lasts in perpetuity as people get involved, and others potentially drop off. But there's always a core group of home group members to keep the doors open, the coffee made, the bills paid, and the message getting sent. Now, you're talking about a more general recovery group meeting so I'd like to try and help where I can, but I'm likely just going to be helpful in maybe thinking of things that might pop based on my experience, that might not be obvious. Off the top of my head, and i'm not a lawyer so this definitely isn't legal advice, but the things I'd want to make sure I know the answers to if I was doing a totally unaffiliated general recovery meeting are as follows: How am I getting the word out about the meeting if I'm unable to post it on any of the local meeting lists for NA/AA/\A etc? What group am I looking to serve that isn't already being served by existing meetings? What extra costs are going to be associated with not having the AA/NA/\A name behind my meeting, as a lot of places tend to charge very little for rent for 12 step affiliated meetings. Will insurance be necessary? If not required by the location, are they ready to take on the costs if something god forbid happens where a person who attended my meeting causes damage or harm to a person or property? What if a group member forgets and leaves the coffee pot on after the meeting is over and there's a fire? Who's on the hook? Could I, personally, be held financially liable if something like this were to occur? If I'm not basing my meeting on any existing program of recovery, what is my meeting format going to be like? What am I going to suggest to a newcomer who walks in the door to get help? What system will be in place to make decisions about this meeting out of the gate, and how will people be able to decide to make changes to the format should they feel it's not doing what it's set out to do? Will I be the end all, be all decision maker? If the format is just going to be general sharing about recovery, do we have any rules or etiquette to follow? What systems are in place to enforce those rules? Sorry about the novel, but I just wanted to give a rundown about how things were done on my end so that you might adapt them to your needs if they're helpful. And I also wanted to provide some questions you might definitely want the answers to before you set anything in stone.

k5de3i5,"I think it’s awesome that you are looking for a sponsor, but may I make a suggestion? Depending on how they work, you may be called upon to chat/call or text them multiple times a week or even daily. Sometimes it helps if you choose a sponsor who lives nearby because you may meet them for step work. I would offer that you first look around and talk to others about their sponsors. Find out how they work with their sponsors, find people who are able to sponsor and speak “your language”. Talk to potential sponsors and ask what type of program they run. My friend put me in touch with a woman that she vibes with and suggested that I ask her to sponsor me. To be honest, my first sponsor was a great woman with a strong program but I did not vibe with her sponsorship. It was a bit too haphazard and rushed for what I needed at that time. I went to a few meetings until I found one that I got a lot out of - my home group, Oasis. In that meeting, there was this woman who was thirty years older, extremely upper class and very intimidating. I don’t know what my ragamuffin soul saw in her but I got to know her better and within two weeks had mentioned that I was looking for a sponsor. We’ve been together ever since and look like an odd couple when we go out to eat. She’s got a punk soul underneath that Doris Day haircut. I love her truly and we chat everyday. I don’t think I could have opened up to anyone I didn’t feel a kinship towards and the steps require rigorous honesty so it better be with someone you feel comfortable with.

I'm sure after coming in and out of recovery for the past 10 years, you already know not to put anything in front of your recovery. It's awesome that you posted this and are looking for suggestions. One thing that has helped me is asking myself, ""What would I say to someone I loved and cared about?"" ""Would I think this situation is alright for a person I care about?"" It has taken me over a decade to not put my needs on the backburner. Asking myself questions like that has helped me with a lot of things in my recovery. I have always wanted better for others.

This situation may be or have been a good fit at some other point in your recovery. But it's not working now if it's got you feeling overwhelmed and unstable. We didn't get clean/sober to be miserable. Do what you feel is going to help you stay sober, healthy, and happy.",1697549868.0
k58k7tf,"“I've had dozens of friends and acquaintances die, so it usually doesn't affect me too much, more mild shock than anything.” that hit me hard. I’ll sometimes try to go through a chronological list in my head of friends I’ve lost - always forgetting a handful… it’s a reminder of how life can be cut so short & to do better for those that can’t. I also just lost a close friend in Dec that shook me- we meet on probation (drug court) & over the short time I knew her I watched her fall & get back up every time. Well, she didn’t have that chance this last time & about 2 months ago her bf lost his chance too. to the OP: I had numerous rock bottoms but what made a difference for me was when I just truly had no more fight in me to keep living in that much pain. I had only known suffering & not true happiness for so many years that I knew I needed to just surrender to someone else’s will- and to the medical staff at whichever treatment facility I was currently at. My best thinking got me to the worst places & I needed serious re-wiring. It’s scary to be told how much work it is going to be but I think its only difficult work if you fight it- which is what we do as addicts & alcoholics. I hope you find what it is that helps you take that next step to the freedom you seek from any or all substances 💜",1697536159.0
k58bkcu," Advanced apology for the wall of text... In Addiction there is a saying that says: ”only when YOU are sick and tired of being sick and tired will you stop” Its about surrender, getting to a point of utter and complete demoralization, where the only options are meeting God one way or another meeting him in death or meeting on the pathway of sobriety... Only YOU know when your sick and tired enough, no one can decide for you when that point of surrender is, however and whenever that may come God is waiting there for you. This 12 step program is a spiritual solution for a physical/emotional/spiritual problem that involves self, humility, surrender and faith in something that we understand very little about and the closest word for it is Love. That Love is waiting for us at our darkest moment in this very very short physical existence. For some of humanity, their egos never let them go there, their self wins and shuts out everything that can express that love, people places things, and they die alone in their aloneness and maybe choose to be alone after death... they are the most unfortunate of us all, and then there are those who never walked away from that love and have stayed connected since birth(very few humans) a fortunate lot they are... however us alcoholic addicts we are the third type where the schoolyard of hard knocks educated us with a 2x4 and eventually humbles us to the point of surrender... Our very addictions, false idols counterfeit gods are the very things the true God of Love will allow us to use to the point where only He and our ego are left in the room of the basement of life, all alone from everything in this world just you and God, where the 12 steps are the only way back to the surface where life and fellow mankind dwell in the sunshine of the spirit... Because for some us there is only one way to the mountain top- the 12 steps, because the spiritual elevator is temporarily broken, we broke it on the way down to the basement, we forget how to pray how to stay connected how to rely on God because we decided to play god for a little while... A.A is full of cute and clever truthful cliches, spiritual mantras and sound bytes... Where plagiarism is actually encouraged. These little sayings given to A.As by that great spirit of Love through the years are the mortar of a new spiritual foundation to stand upon and lean upon when the storms of life arise. The 12 steps will help you live life on life's terms without the need or want of alcohol and drugs, because with God all things are possible, God works through people, uses the people of AA to show his love, give respite and shelter from the storms and living hell spawned of self will run riot. Of course you know you find those people at A.A family meetings, where meetings are akin to a bus (where there's free coffee and a seat with your name on it, it even has a smoking area) the 12 steps are the map that we use to navigate the trip by (because our ego driven GPS is a Dumb Dumb not a Tom Tom) where prayer and service is the fuel for that vehicle we travel in together through life, its a great a great big bus where everybody in it has the same ultimate destination, that bus has a driver (we all call him God) and everything is good as long as God is left to drive that bus and you dont get off at the wrong bus stop (lots of us have and let us tell you its no fun, nearly killing us in the process where ultimately humility wins because God loves us) because of resentment boredom pride fear etc etc. No matter what though you always get back on the bus, your fellow AA/12 step passengers will attempt to patch you up the best they can with the help of God if you let them. There's always a seat with your name on it Im just another bozo on that bus, welcome aboard and please stick around for awhile after your sick and tired of being sick and tired, you are wanted, you are needed, there are others who will need your love bandages after they too become sick and tired of being sick and tired and get on the Bus... This wall of text is one bozo's observation/opinion/cleverness after nearly 40 years without a drink. P.s. We, me, us, your 12 step family/sponsor and God, will help you work on that broken elevator thing. In the meantime there's the 12 steps- Get to a meeting!

For online meetings, if you’re not finding many in your area, plug in a major city like NYC or LA and a bunch will pop up that you can match up with your schedule. 12-step has never helped me, but SMART Recovery has been amazing. It’s more research and science based, not the random ramblings of a guy named Bill. It’s also more tolerant of moderation and they also don’t emphasize counting days, or the concept of having to re-start from zero if you have a setback or a relapse. If 12-step does work for you, great! But it does not work for many, and people deserve to know that there are effective alternatives out there. There’s also the Sinclair Method, which is taking medication that lowers your alcohol cravings. There’s a sub called r/alcoholism_medication that has a lot more info, and there are various options to consider. In addition, the r/stopdrinking sub is an extremely supportive and wonderful community, if you’re not already aware.

It was a realization that my life wasn’t fulfilled and that the drugs just really weren’t working anymore. Getting sober is all about making a choice, not experiencing something tragic. Rock bottom for me was just coming to terms that my dumbass choices were the one and only thing that was causing me such a shitty life, a life I chose to live in for over 15 years in active addiction.

I got up every day and went to work, walked a lot, ate healthy food and started therapy. It all helped. About 5 years ago I did it again twice and I actually hated it (I broke my back after two years off of coke and ended up hooked on opiates).

k4u476l,"Honestly, this was a struggle (being 100% sober). Even coke, I got clean for seven months, relapsed and started to do “party only”, much smaller amounts, once or twice a month… My therapist knew - it was a phase of “damage reduction”. During 2020 I went on a couple of overnight benders again and decided to quit coke for good. That’s when the drinking problem started - I would binge drink to “replace” cocaine. So I had to address that. Have in mind that I have been on this road of recovery and self-improvement since 2017 - I was a heavy coke addict during 2015/2016. Since 2021, I managed to reduce my drinking, I love a good cocktail and I can go out, have two or three drinks, and call it a night. I do that probably once a month, and have an ocasional glass of wine on a Friday night. So yes, I think my life is “normal”. At least, my normal, my “party” habits have no influence in my social or work life anymore. Cocaine cravings finally went away, I can go out and have fun with friends, go home to sleep and next morning I am good as new. I think each one has to find what suits you best. The fact that I now only hang out with people that drink little and do zero drugs helps a lot. I can’t be around coke. If someone lays me a line, I’ll probably do it and regret it for an entire month, so I just stay the hell away. But I will not actively try to find it, you know what I mean? Recovery to me has been a very long process of adjusting myself, knowing myself better, controlling my mood and my impulses… It took me only a few months to get back into being productive, working, living a regular life, but it took me years to feel whole again, to feel happy and secure of who I am, and what I want… It’s an inside job, and I don’t think you ever stop working on yourself, there’s always new things to learn, new feelings to develop… Sobriety (or not) is just a part of who we are, I think.

After a nasty relapse, I started seeing a therapist and she changed everything, she saved my life. What others said are all right - exercise, eating healthy, sunlight, lots of sunlight, personally I like to be in touch with nature - the beach, the park, anything outdoors keeps me happy and away from intrusive thoughts. Being close to family or clean friends is also a great way to keep yourself busy and clean. But in therapy, she made me address the reasons why I was self-medicating and later, self-destructing with obscene amounts of blow… She used jungian therapy and that worked really well for me, to the point my life got so much better in other areas, I really came out of addiction a better person than I was before, and I owe to therapy. I strongly suggest you see at least a therapist. Like you, I got an awesome job while still in active addiction, I thought I could get clean for it… I did, for the first few months. But soon the job got super demanding, very stressful, I’m sure you can guess what happened… I started coping with blow again, and it went downhill pretty fast. If I was already seeing my therapist at that time, I’m sure I could have saved my job and spared myself an entire year of awful ups and downs. I tell you this not to discourage you, on the contrary.

The app is able to record my snoring, moving etc, and on mornings that I’m feeling untested or that I was tossing and turning, I can check those recordings and almost always I find that I was snoring at least at some point. I also discovered I sleep talk! Lol There’s a podcast I like on Apple Podcasts called Nothing Much Happens which helps me drift off. Also, have you tried a loud fan? It might seem crazy and there was a time that I wouldn’t even have considered it - but my sleep issues started waaaaay before my meth use. When I can’t sleep it’s usually because my brain won’t stop paying attention to things I’m hearing or seeing, or waiting to hear or see. Having a loud fan, or even a “wave machine” have both been helpful to drown out background noise. The wave machine is especially helpful as they are “long waves”, if you will, that allow for very slow, very deep breaths. I often use it with the fan. It’s enough that I wake up to sounds in the street without it, but can sleep through the same sounds with it.",1697163809.0

I think it was called pristiq? When i saw a psychiatrist they were like this is not for you. I felt huge relief when i got off of it. Anyway i didnt know all that at the time so stupid me did some google research and found a 'harmless' plant called kratom that could help me. I ordered it and i never took lorazepam again and the withdrawals were gone and i felt instantly better. But then i had a 6 year addiction to kratom. Fun!!

k4brv2b,"So, first off, tooth pain is unbelievably visceral and commands your attention in a way a lot of other types of pain just don't. Now, unfortunately, first-line opioids like codeine are kinda garbage at managing this type of pain (for most of us). The pain relief most people get from Tylenol 3 is on par with what they get from regular tylenol and motrin (or another NSAID). It does help with managing pain through sleep, but again not more than much safer alternatives (tylenol pm + motrin). As far as abuse risk goes, codeine is considered relatively low-risk (among opioids...it's still an opioid, so the risk is not insignificant). It's not uncommon for physicians to try this when managing moderate acute pain of patients with a history of opioid use disorder. BUT at the same time, I would never expect to see a physician put someone with a history of SUD on any opioid analgesic for a month unless there was just no other way. Even a patient without that kind of history, it's not typical for something like this, where the pain can be remediated permanently and completely with an office procedure. I'm looking at this from American eyes though, I'm not sure if that's where you are (I would guess probably not) but if so...I might consider getting a second opinion asap. Either way, if it's me, I would avoid taking these as much as possible. I understand that this is very serious and very real pain, but just try everything else first.",1696970884.0

k46p5x4,"I feel like this. I’ve honestly come a very very long way. Here are some of the activities that have helped me. 1. Therapy when it was in my health insurance. 2. Chat GPT: I will ask questions like: “what are a list of core values?” And then I’ll select my top 5 favorite and ask “how can I incorporate these into my lifestyle on a daily, weekly or monthly basis?” I’ll try to schedule some of these activities as a way to figure out what I actually like. And I’ll also ask Chat GPT anything about anything: “how do I cope with xyz?” “What’s a cheap hobby to take up?” “How do I stop feeling so unmotivated?” 3. Journaling: just get things off ur chest super honestly. I get paranoid someone will see my writing so I use penzu.com (very unknown and private). I also think it’s helpful to look back and see how much better I’m doing. Also, make a list of 10 things you like about yourself. Are you curious, open minded, creative, loyal?? Re-read this list. Anything u don’t like about yourself think of how u can improve. 4. Making conversation notes: sometimes before I see someone I know I like hanging out with and want to make the encounter pleasant, I’ll make notes for the days leading up of questions I want to ask them: “how’s that project you said you were working on? / how’s your band?” Or even funny jokes n stuff I’ll write down in case I wanna use them. My follow up question is always some form of “are you enjoying it / is it going as you planned / did you enjoy it?” 5. Along those lines - counting to ten!!! I’ll count to ten slowly in my head when someone else is talking. My social anxiety leads me to cutting ppl off sometimes because I wanna interject to connect or to let them know that I can relate. But it will make them feel like you’re not really listening. So I’ll count to ten and make a mental note of my thought and try to say it a little while later after the person got their story out. 6. Working in service industry/strip club. People will be rude to u no matter how nice or cool u seem, so it creates a bit more of a tough skin - some ppl are not meant to like u. So you can be yourself without being fearful of judgment.. it’s the philosophy of practice makes perfect.

k41n8cg,"You are either not on a high enough dose of suboxone or you are not taking it as prescribed, maybe both. If you really have given suboxone an honest try and it still doesn't work, than you might be a candidate for methadone. Methadone is no something you want to consider, but if nothing else works, if can be a life saver. I would find a sub on reddit about suboxone and find out if the amount you take compares to what other people are stable on. On the correct amount of replacement therapy, your cravings should be blocked. You need to figure out if your dose is high enough. If you are at a high dose and taking it regularly, then you will want to consider methadone. The right dose of methadone can release you from the cravings and help you get your life back on track. Once free of street drugs, then you can start to taper. But, getting off methadone is not easy. It is a slow process. Dropping 1-2 mg a week from 80-120mg takes time. The good thing is that it gives you the time to develop skills for living sober while having the medication in your system to support your sobriety.",1696800270.0

Brain health is like body health. You have to put in some effort. And, your level of current health, your eating and sleeping habits, stress levels, etc... will affect how long it takes. Also, if you spend a lot of time feeling anxious about it, that won't help your brain health. Being mindful of staying neutral, keeping an open mind is important in maintaining a healthy brain.

k3xlvg5,"I tried a million times on my own before my daughter was born and it never really worked. I’d always go back and when she came into our lives, I began a speed run to the bottom. Becoming a parent knocked out the worst in me. I recognize now that I had so much unprocessed feelings and emotions from major life events and I had even worse ideas about how to be a good parent. I was fast tracking a life I swore up and down I would never repeat. I went to rehab when my daughter was about 5 months old and I was not welcome in their lives if or when I got out. But I did the work anyways and I found help. I made living amends as I went and never stopped contributing. Actions spoke louder than words and my words didn’t mean jack shit anyways so I continued to work on it. I had the chance to repair relationships and strengthen others and I made my way back. She’s almost 5 now and she has a little brother. For a while I was saying that I was sober for my daughter. I even had a little picture to remind me to take medication and go to meetings but it wasn’t enough. I have to do this for me so that’s what I say. It sounds insane to say out loud but my sobriety comes first and is higher on my priority list than my kids. I know I’m no good to them if I’m out there drinking, lying, hiding and drugging. Having a shot at breaking the cycle of addiction is a huge motivation but that’s not why I’m sober. I’m doing this for me. And I’ll be honest and open with them when it’s time. They already understand that they can always have a sip of my drinks and that I don’t stay out late. I’d rather be with them. I love being a sober dad but sometimes I feel like I’m on an island because parents fucking drink. Some of these moms would seriously drink me under the table and I consider myself a gold medal drunk Olympian. But I have support in others who work on sobriety like I do and I stay connected. I talk about it because it’s too important not to and I’ve mostly only encountered overwhelming support.

Do something to manage the isolation aspect, to get you out and about and help with your self esteem….consider your hobbies and interests and join a class/adult education. See what free activities are available in your town. Try to meet people with similar interests to you. Make an effort to see (or at least speak to) your friends.

k3vegz9,"Just because you're not using, doesn't mean you're not addicted. I don't know if you've ever hear the term ""dry drunk"", but that term applies to addicts, too. Basically what it means is that you're not using, but nothing has really changed mentally. Staying sober is only one of the many things you need to do in order to make recovery successful. You need to find a program of recovery that works for you, and stick to it. This could mean 12 step meetings, smart recovery, Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), or any number of things that I'm sure I'm forgetting. It could be one of these, a couple of these, or small pieces of all of them put together in your own unique way. I would also recommend figuring out a way to see a mental health professional. I don't know where you live, but if it's a medium-large size city, they'll have programs where you can get some sort of free or discounted assistance. I would definitely recommend looking into that.

I carried on for a little while that way until my frame of mind got worse. I started to do things that I said I would never do. Day by day and month by month I started to break down emotionally and life got overwhelming. I wanted everyone to leave me alone, but all they did was ask more of me. I started to think that the only way out was to run away from what I had. I had a husband, a daughter, three beautiful grandchildren, and my mom close in my life. If I ran away, I’d have to give up all of them. I couldn’t do it. I started to ask myself what was missing and soon found out it was my purpose. We’ll I thought I had purpose serving those people in my life that loved me but it wasn’t fulfilling. I thought I had purpose serving in meetings I go to but that wasn’t my purpose either. Right now I’m in the middle of another round of step work that is helping me to dig a little deeper into what the purpose of the steps really are and it’s helping me to see that I don’t really live for my purpose anymore. I’ve been given the gift of sobriety to live for another purpose. It’s always been about what I want and my focus needs to be different. Trusting and relying upon the power of the universe to define what my purpose is. I have to trust the guidance and direction will come if I really want it. Don’t get me wrong, some days I think it’s complete bullshit. Other days it works. Things just lineup. It’s the right time. It’s the right person. It’s the right conversation. Its these times I didn’t have anything to do with planning it. It just happens. It turns out the more I try the more often this happens.

The care part is: Go to your doctor to get a check up (blood work etc), a healthy way of eating, get 8 hours of sleep, get exercise (start with a dedicated walk everyday). The training is: Read - even if you weren’t a reader before, find books with any subject that interests you (fiction, like mysteries, spy thrillers or whatever, or nonfiction like history, or biographies), LIMIT your social media doom scrolling - this is key as social media is another addiction that impacts the cognitive abilities you want to regain. This will be challenging, but begin and continue even if you feel like it’s not helping. It’s ok if you read and your mind wanders. When you notice you’re lost in thought, just go back to reading again. It’s about the effort, not your memory recall. The more you read, the more you’ll improve even if you don’t think you are. Socialize. This is another critical component. Often, when we put down a substance, we find that some of the people we spent time with don’t fit in with your new weed free lifestyle. That’s ok. But Isolating isn’t good for our brains, so we need to make sure we make the effort to spend time with the friends who support us (by not using or being high around us) and making new friends.

k31o9u4,"Something I regularly come back to is that I would have not ended up where I am - sober, truly happy for the first time since childhood - if I had not taken the path I took. It was 7 years from when I first got out of my first rehab until I started an actual sober lifestyle. My life imploded and then I had to rebuild from the hole that came from the implosion. Awful decisions for me seem to be how I learn. I have refined that a little to 'I tend to learn things best the hard way'. I knew what I needed to do to be sober leaving that first rehab stint, but it took me 7 years to learn it. Achieving sobriety happens to be far more visible to the outside world because consequences are more visible and nearer-term. But people follow the same broken, winding journey to learning all kinds of other things: dieting, relationships, work performance, etc. Recovery is also learning. You're demonstrating that in making this post and reflecting on your past. I spoke to myself (and still do sometimes) like you're speaking about yourself in your post. I learned that I needed to go easier on myself, not harder. Forgiving myself for my past helped me find new purpose moving forward.

k317pe0,"It’s pretty much one of the things that falls under PAWS (Post-Acute Withdrawal Symptoms). There’s definitely some significant reorientation of brain chemistry going on during this phase. Also, from a psychological standpoint there’s dealing with the stuff that substances helped cover up, dealing with any consequences of the substance abuse, and then grieving the substance itself…. Those first several months can be really hard. It’s part of the reason why sober/clean time doesn’t really mean much to me anymore. I have 13 years sober, but a big part of the reason why I can continue to stay sober is just how absolutely hard those first few months were. Someone with 30-60 days, if they’re staying strong and still clawing their way out, they’re an inspiration to me. My “tough” shit today is maybe working too many hours, aches and pains from getting older or trying to get a good APR on a vehicle loan. That’s a far cry from someone who is currently going through that insanely spastic biological, spiritual and psychological rollercoaster that is early sobriety. When I’m feeling exceptionally sorry for myself due to whatever trauma du hour is going on, I have to stop and remind myself that if I was able to sober with 25 days, no money, no permanent residence, no job, and no real hope… it would be pretty ridiculous to even think about considering going back out because they raised my rent and then my car broke down.",1696185554.0

k2yk87n,"Just seeing this while looking for some advice/commiseration on Reddit. You posted over a month ago, so you may not even see this, but I felt compelled to share, though you may not like what I have to say. This could have been my parents posting. I am a 37 year old daughter of alcoholic parents. You say you never physically struck her and were functional. While you may not have physically abused her, I promise your choice to drink impacted her. It took me into my 30s before I realized just how much my parents drinking had affected me as a teenager. From confusing or cruel things said while drunk, to being unwilling/unable to take me to high school football games, to embarrassing me in front of my friends by being drunk. I thought we were close, but my parents take us a cautionary one. If you haven’t sought help for your alcoholism, please reconsider doing so. My parents went back and forth between drinking and trying to control their drinking. My dad was even sober for five years, while my moms drinking worsened in that time. When he retired, my dad picked up drinking with gusto. In the past 9 months, he’s been hospitalized due to withdrawals (from repeatedly trying to quit) six times. My mom went from functional to absolutely not functional. Her drinking led to severe depression. She does nothing but sit on the couch and drink. She was recently diagnosed with cognitive impairment as a result of her drinking and poor nutrition. In the past few years, they’ve made plans with me, only to cancel them repeatedly due to “not feeling well.” Last year for Christmas, I reminded them I don’t want them to drink in front of me, and that the Christmas dinner I worked hard on would be an alcohol free event. They snuck in alcohol anyway. They ruined yet another Christmas with me and their grandkids by getting sloshed. That hurt. The next day they “didn’t feel well,” and canceled the plans they’d made with us. Despite repeated hospitalizations due to health issues exacerbated by heavy alcohol use, they refuse to help themselves. I have tried, again and again, to get through to them. I’ve missed work and time with my own family and friends to care for them, even having my dad live with me at one point after a bad bout of aspiration pneumonia he acquired while vomiting after drinking. I’m exhausted. I finally gave up lighting myself on fire to keep two people warm who won’t even attempt to reach for a blanket. I cannot help people who refuse to help themselves. I cannot watch them continue to destroy themselves and burden me with stress and hurt and anguish. My dad is right now in the hospital. My mom cannot care for herself and didn’t even bother to call or text to let me know. The sad part is, I’m pretty apathetic about it. If my parents want a relationship with me and my family, they need to show it. They need to for once choose US over alcohol. They won’t. They love the alcohol more, and have shown that to be true so many times over so many years. It hurts, but therapy helped. Im going to do better by my own kids. Not seeing my parents hurts, but not as much as it hurts to have a front row seat to their destruction. My parents ask me to call more. My dad says how sorry he is. He’s relapsed at least eight times. My mom refuses to acknowledge she even has a problem, despite it being absolutely obvious and destroying every single relationship she had. I don’t hate them. I pity them. I grieve the loss of the parents I thought I had at one time. But it would take a VERY long time of consistent change and effort to even begin to undo the years of selfishness they’ve built up. You want a relationship? Work on yourselves. Get well. Really reflect and own your role in this. But just get well. The best way my parents at this point could show me they love me, is by starting to love themselves.",1696134471.0
k2xw32i,"I don't know exactly what you mean and I don't understand what you are saying by using the ellipsis (...) and the word ""assimilate"" but I agree with everything else you said. There is a story in the 3rd edition of the book called ""The Big Book"" and the entire story use to be called ""Doctor Addict Alcoholic."" It's an extremely well read and considered story and people would regularly name off certain page numbers without even quoting the text. Many people were sponsored to read the story or parts of the story because of the powerful message of recovery in that passage. It is certainly one of my favorite sections of the entire book. It has changed my life because the lessons are so truly helpful and universal to soany of us who are alcoholics and/or addicts. Also, many people, maybe even millions of people would introduce themselves at various recovery meetings and certainly AA meetings as ""My name is [name] and I am an Addict/Alcoholic."" Years later, the 4th edition of the book came out. The entire chapter had a different name and I think it was ""Acceptance is the Answer."" They literally changed the name of the chapter! I hear that the 5th edition of the book is on the way and I wonder if the name will be changed again or if the book will maybe have eliminated that story altogether. Who knows? Over the years I have learned that many people in AA and NA get really bent out of shape about these things. I would just seethe and broil in my anger when some ""old timer"" would make a passive aggressive or even straight up aggressive comment toward a very well meaning newer person who was just coming to a meeting for help. One meeting it got so bad that they had a ""singleness of purpose"" statement that they would read in the opening to the meeting. Apparently that group was getting too popular and this was when the methamphetamine pandemic was hitting our community really hard. Old timer AAs were put off by the rapid influx of so many new and somewhat younger people. The bottoms were coming faster and younger with that particular powder at that time, 15 years ago. Ironically relevant because OP is struggling with Adderall which is chemically similar to meth, only it is a prescription medication. Anyway, I fully agree that an addict is an addict. But not everyone feels that way. And this is heavily debated and argued over by reasonable people with various positions on the matter. I think people who don't want to hear about other kinds of addicts and other kinds of substances at AA meetings have literally forgotten where they came from and have lost track of what their literature says about the matter. But they can counter with ""singleness of purpose"" and the rest of it. At the end of the day I have just stepped aside from this debate in the context of meetings and 12 step recovery fellowships. It comes down to outside issues and it can become a distraction to everyone. OP needs a place to talk about her Adderall cravings. I would suggest talking about it in a general way while at an AA meeting. I think that potentially she could identify a sponsor and some other alcoholics or addicts in recovery that she could talk about this with privately and get an empathetic or constructive response. If she talks about it in an open, or especially a ""closed"" AA meeting, then she is going to occasionally have a response where people are being kind of assholes about it. If she talks about being an ""alcoholic"" at an NA meeting, some people may roll their eyes or shift in their seats uneasily about it. This is the reality that we are in. What is considered polite and reality are different things on a regular basis and recovery fellowships are no exception to that. The polite thing to do is to remember the purpose of the fellowship and use language that fits the purpose of that fellowship. An alternative is to talk ""in a general way"" about the issue or substance that is a concern.",1696122636.0

k2xhyek,"I was like that. I’ve been told the good news about sobriety is that you get your feelings back. And the bad news is that you get your feelings back. That’s still true for me 4 years after my last drink. In the early days I was filled with regret, shame, guilt. I wasn’t very kind to myself when I was drinking and I continued to punish myself in early sobriety. I didn’t learn about self forgiveness yet. I’ve heard people say they, but I couldn’t do it for myself. I now believe self care is a form of self forgiveness for me and sometimes that means giving myself a break from wallowing in my own misery. A walk or a shower helps. But I’m my own worst enemy and when I’m trapped in my head, I’m stuck with an asshole. I had to get out of my comfort zone to get out of my head. I don’t do it alone, I talk with real people in real life and they are everywhere. I spent a lot of time isolated. Even when I was amongst friends and family I wasn’t telling the truth and o never let anyone know. I already know how to cut people out or shut the door to be by myself. The tricky part was trying anything different. I learned how to let go of a lot of anger and resentments. I’m often left with sadness but that’s ok. I don’t have to drink.

k2w5b4d,"A lot of drug addicts get clean in AA. Other substances are considered “outside issues” in the program as it focuses on just one substance - Mentioning drugs or identifying as an addict steps outside of what’s conventional for the meetings or in line with traditions and you may be met with silence or someone might explain it to you after, etc. it’s just how they roll. NA covers all drugs and makes no distinction between them, alcohol included - Decorum there would be to identify as an addict and not an alcoholic or a particular kind of addict or mention any specific drugs as what a person used isn’t important. They’re only concerned with what you want to do about your problem and how they can help, they approach it as addressing the disease of addiction in totality rather than just particular substances. The rigidity of these traditions in the programs are there for good reasons - It isn’t to ostracize anyone or exclude anyone, it’s to maintain their primary purpose and provide identification for who the problems are intended to help. The similarities between someone who is a “purebred” alcoholic and someone who’s only done drugs that aren’t alcohol are substantial, it all takes us to the same places one way or another. What’s common for drug addicts who opt for AA is to identify as alcoholics in meetings and to keep drug names and drugs in general out of their shares, replace alcohol with drugs in their heads as they go through the literature. Cosplaying verbally as an alcoholic isn’t the worst thing that’s ever happened to anybody and if it’s the difference between life or death, I’d identify as a Christmas tree if it got me the goods I needed to stay above ground. The twelve steps are the same in both AA and NA aside from some verbiage and the process of going through them is largely the same as well, different literature but the same foundation.",1696096982.0

AA is not a fan of people’s issues with addiction. This is baffling because alcoholism is simply the state of being addicted to alcohol. So surprise, AA is a hypocritical mess. What you experienced is classic cult member behavior. You can tell because of the complete lack of compassion for anyone who doesn’t preach the party line. While I know that not all AA members are like this - I wasn’t for the last few years I was there before I left a decade ago - it’s the hopelessly flawed dogmatic program that tells (it says “suggest”, but make no mistake, they are orders) members that anything other than alcohol is an “outside issue”.

k2twef1,"Full disclosure: I take Concerta. I’m also about 6 months off sublocade. That’s it. I’m here to go against the grain and say that if you truly have ADHD you might consider stimulant medication. Personally , I waited until I had 5 years sober. At 5 years, our chances of picking up are on par with the general (non-addicted) population. At that time, I also felt secure enough in my sobriety. I was going back to college as well. So I felt the benefits outweighed the minimal risk. Even with all that, I took certain steps to try to reduce that risk even more. I tried non-stimulants (wellbutrin- I couldn’t tolerate the med). When it was apparent that a stimulant medication might be needed, I asked for a long-acting form (protective factor against addiction - shorter acting meds are more likely to perpetuate that addictive cycle of highs/lows). I was also willing to try a methylphenidate form bc I had previously “abused” Adderall (it wasn’t really abuse, it was self medicating, I took only 10 mg/day, but it wasn’t prescribed). I’ve been stable on 36 mg Concerta for about 2 years. It has helped me so much to be able to balance personal responsibilities, a full time job, and college classes.

k2s680t,"I would highly recommend considering trying Wellbutrin. I was a serious abuser of empathogens (i.e. mdma, benzofurans), with some add/adhd stims, and it totaled my dopamine system. I was so couch-locked, unmotivated, and SSRIs did fuck all for me. My psychiatrist i currently have is awesome. He appreciates and respects my understanding of neurochemistry/medication knowledge (ive worked in the medical/mental health field and he's the first to not seem to take offense that I express knowledge and insight about medications.) I previously used SSRIs, which would help, but my focus and motivation were nonexistent. I communicated this to him, that I didn't feel I had a serotonin issue any longer, but that aspect was the issue. So, he introduced Wellburtin, and we identified it was a dopamine issue. I couldn't believe how within two weeks I felt motivated to hit up friends, do shit and not stay on my couch doomscrolling. I was unaware it's prescribed as well for smoking cessation (i was a super heavy vaper), and it inspired me to quit nicotine. I'm not sure if you use anything like thc or nicotine, but I also realized that those things were not letting the Wellburtin hit full capacity as those items do also hit dopamine receptors. After I got off nicotine and took healthy space from thc, my goodness, that was the key. I'm not here to force psych meds on you or anyone, just to consider it. It definitely repaired my dopamine system, and I now feel like a real human again - going to the gym, hitting up friends, doing things i normally would decline to do with my wife or friends. So, if you ever want to consider it (and I hope you do), I'd love to hear about your experience. It lifted me out of a deeper depression I didn't realize I was in, and now I'm augmenting real adaptive activities, so once we start tapering me off (as that's always been the goal) I'll have a significantly more stable dopamine system and, if i stay committed to these activities, I know I'll be good. Good luck, OP. I know how tough it can be. You got this.",1696023617.0

k2qpkag,"Normal taper schedules by western med for ALL psych drugs is absolute hogwash. I wouldn't jump off at .5mg, especially if you're taking it daily for more than a couple of weeks. The main thing, you have to change your mental/emotional perspective and you have to be determined to get off of it. And if I were you, I would find that determination because this drug can become a total nightmare. Get off of it!!!! Not to scare you at all. You're in a good spot and can get off with some tools and patience, promise. I broke my dose up, I did .25mg in morning and then .25mg at night for about 2 weeks. Then I moved to a quarter pill in morning which is like .12.5mg in morning, 25mg at night for 2 weeks. Then I took away morning dose, and took .25mg at night for about a week. Took that down to .125mg for about a week, then I moved to every other day for about a week, then stopped. The most important advice is listen to your body. If you start having intolerable symptoms of withdrawal, take dose back up as low as possible. The trick is...listening to your body, not your mind. Because your mind will ALWAYS tell you to take it, and more. You will experience rebound anxiety, to what degree I don't know. We are all different, and will have different experiences with taper schedules and withdrawal symptoms. Sounds like you mostly need it at night. You need to set up a good nightly routine to unwind. Turning off social media and or TV. Meditate. Journal to get days thoughts out. Take a hot shower or bath to relax your body, get in bed with an engaging book. Take melatonin to help you sleep (but only for a short time, don't take that forever cuz it is a synthetic hormone). Try l-theanine, ashwagandha, 5 htp, nighttime tea. You need to actively work on getting your cortisol down. If you don't already, start exercising. Even walking helps a ton. Sweat either through exercise or sauna to help your body detox. Eat healthy! Take supplements like B vitamins and Magnesium glycinate to help mood. Since you only take it night, you could keep doing what you're doing. Slowly cut the dose down at night. You're going to be uncomfortable, so get comfortable with that idea. It's not the easiest road, but it's totally doable. I've been off for awhile now and I will never ever touch it again, it's playing with the devil. You can do this, but you have to ride it out, remind yourself daily that you won't always feel this way and things will get better....because they will.

At my highest, I was using 6-8 mg a day. Lately, I’ve been on 3 mg a day, plus Ambien for sleep. Well, I’m out of Ambien and tapering off of Xanax for the last week. Managed to get down to 2 mg a day. But I freaked out about having a seizure after reading these comments and I can’t. Im terrified that they’ll take my kid away when I’m just trying to do the right thing. I haven’t slept in two days, so I took 1.5 mg all at once just now with four cups of chamomile tea.

k2n6b51,"Can you share your rough 6 week taper schedule from .5 mg Xanax? I never thought I’d be here but I’ve taken my .5 mg Xanax almost daily for around 4 months (it was probably closer to .25 at the start of that). I’m down to about 75 .5 mg pills and realize the need to taper. I’ve almost exclusively taken it at bed time for sleep, drink no alcohol, no other gaba drugs. I have a lot of gaba pen tin on hand but IIRC that doesn’t hit same receptors to help benzo wd. I honestly think a lot of issue is in my head. I keep trying to take just 3/4 of a .5 pill to begin taper to .25 (1/2 of a pill) and then this nagging voice in my head when I can’t fall asleep after 15 min - which is a normal life long problem for me - tells myself it must be that “missing” 1/4 of a .5 pill keeping me awake. Which…it could be…but I think psychosomatic is at least half of the contribution. Anyway, I’ve been scouring the web for taper strategies from this dose, and have read everything to “that’s going to be substantial WDl to “.5 is nothing for only 6 months just do quick taper by halving dose and jump off” No idea, but guessing reality falls in the middle. It’s a subtle thing I think that maybe contributes to a day feeling more off, I’m not sure.

The use of the word “God” was uncomfortable at first for me in the rooms of rehab and NA. A couple people referred to God as Group of Drunks, or Great Outdoors. I like hiking/nature so I gravitated more toward viewing the word God to mean Great Outdoors. At NA the term “higher power” is used a lot, and is referred to as “my higher power as I understand him/it/them/whatever” implying that not everybody’s higher power is the same, and even encouraging those with different opinions on the matter to still be in recovery together. I believe somewhere in the everyday meeting literature it even says it’s “a simple, spiritual, non-religious program, known as Narcotics Anonymous” It’s not supposed to be religious. The people that try to make it religious for themselves are fine, but those who try to make it religious for others are crossing a line, in my opinion.

k2l8epj,"I tried suboxone first. Even if I kicked cold turkey for several days before taking even 2mg of suboxone, I was still getting precipitated withdrawal. I was also in an extremely abusive relationship, and they were hell bent on using heroin to control me. At my highest methadone dose, I was all the way up to 155mgs, and I didn't stop using fully till I was there. And like I said, I've spent the last two years tapering off, all the way down to 15mgs. I'm not going to switch treatments. Methadone is an opiate agonist, I couldn't get on suboxone without fully kicking methadone anyway. Additionally, and I felt like the tone of my post made this clear, but I do not enjoy methadone. My teeth are rotting out of my fucking head, I've had 6 pulled in the last two years and I need at least 6 root canals and filings in literally every single other tooth. Methadone is poison. My favorite name I've ever heard for methadone is ""liquid handcuffs"". Some people might enjoy it. I am not part of them, or why would I be weaning off.

Being a mother is more rewarding and is literally the only thing I've ever wanted to be. Like I said in my post, my issue is with trust and connection. To provide more context for this, I'm 29 and the majority of my friends are dead. Trust and connection means opening myself up to hurt like that again.

k1ivfa1,I'm going to break it down to you simply. Addiction doesn't exist for you to prove a point it doesn't exist for you to write a paper and it doesn't exist for you to have a career in research and a career in medicine. I explained to you in a previous post that there are people who have lived with active addiction and active alcoholism for a majority of their entire lives yet they have managed on their own without a degree to find a solution and work the solution in their lives and they have managed to do what no one in the medical profession and no one in the scientific profession has been able to do which is offer them a solution for a disorder that was killing them slowly consistently on a daily basis. Whether you understand it or not and whether you can explain it or not is a moot point and a non-issue in the lives of people who are in recovery and the lives of people who need recovery. If that doesn't help you understand it go out and cop your own addiction you figure it out with your own real world research and then you come back here and talk to the rest of us about it who've actually been through it and are actually doing the damn business of staying clean and sober.,1695272269.0

If it's at all an option, I'd really recommend looking into inpatient treatment options if you can. When I finally decided to surrender to my shitshow of a life and actually TRY to do this, I realized rulll quick that I wasn't going to be able to string more than a day or two together without some extra help. AA was/is great and gave me lots of hope and an awesome community to connect with, but.. I knew that I needed to be locked up somewhere with absolutely no access to booze or drugs, or I was never going to pickup a 30 day coin. I used to think it was 'so embarrassing' to go to rehab and vowed that I would never allow myself to stoop to that level (which is hilarious because at the time, my day to day life was preetty fucking embarrassing haha), but once I made that decision to go, I was kinda excited and ready to be anywhere else but where I was. Idk it felt like jumping off a cliff with no idea what's going to happen, but I was ready for whatever because life had gotten so so miserable.. anything is up from here, right? Also, I knew that it'd be pretty crucial for me to completely remove myself from my current living environment, and also take some space away from my family while I got my bearings in soberville. (My fam is fantastic and we're super close, but they don't always understand the addiction thing and I knew their frequent input and micromanaging would be more harm than help) Anyways, going away was truly the best decision I've ever made. I ended up having a blast at rehab (which probably isn't the norm), but you're in this really unique environment without regular life stressors to worry about, and all you really have focus on, is healing. Or trying to at least. Also addicts and alcoholics are some of the funniest, most intelligent mofos out there, so we had some fun. I learned how to laugh again (like actually belly laughs), eat like an adult, fall asleep and wake up without popping pills :), have genuine and present conversation with others, and (this is cliche) but I really did learn to love myself again over those few weeks. Walking in there, I honestly couldn't remember the last time I didn't have some kind of drug or drink in my system, and I didn't really know who I was anymore or what my baseline was without substances. It's been a little over a year since I started on this journey and while I still oftentimes suck at life and internally talk shit to myself all the time, the love for myself did indeed remain.

k1cciqn,"> I bought some Melatonin instead with the hopes of improving my sleep Yes! On that note btw, play around with the amount of Melatonin if you're using it for sleep. Less is usually more. I actually find 0.5-1mg helps sleep much more than larger amounts (if you have larger doses you can usually just chop them smaller). This is because Melatonin is a sleep-regulating hormone rather than a sleep promoting substance like say sleeping meds, so too much of it can throw off your sleep rather than helping it. Some people find chamomile tea good for mild benzo withdrawals too, both for helping sleep and relieving the symptoms. Actually I find it kinda like Melatonin in the less is more aspect too, where 1-2 cups of it relieves my anxiety/helps me sleep but more than that does nothing.",1695165275.0
k1cbp7i,"It might sound cliche but I think it helps to identify what void (or voids) you're filling with those things. What prompts you to eat or smoke, and what issue in your life is it in some way trying to treat? For me alcohol was trying to treat a social deficit. I liked that I became more outgoing when I drank, and since I've been very isolated socially lately I sort of used it as a crutch, when really what I was trying to treat was the feeling of being isolated - something to be done by connecting with/talking to others, rather than drinking. Opioids were similar when I was addicted to those just under a decade ago. Treating the same deficit but in the opposite manner. Opioids didn't make me social, far from it, but they made me feel content/safe/cared for in the way social interactions do, even though I was isolating myself more and more. Again, the real solution would have been to connect more with my friends, meet new people, etc, but instead I masked the issue with drugs. Now I never had a problem with weed/smoking too much of it, though I've quit that too, but I still feel like it was there for me to try to fill a void - which for me was feeling like I struggled to really relax/let go of my stress during the day. When I smoked I felt like I relaxed easier - but what I really needed was more relaxing hobbies, and mindful relaxation that I actually planned out beforehand, to eliminate myself procrastinating in indecision unsure what to watch/read/play/whatever. So if you ask yourself right now, what hole do you think the sugar and weed were filling in your life? Can you think of any answers? Can you think of some healthy things you could do to treat those deficits in the place of trying to mask them? :) Since both of these habits can be connected to food - sugar because well it IS food, and weed because of you eating more when you smoked, what about getting into cooking/meal prep? And learning to make healthy filling meals? It'd be a great fun way to pass the time, plus the nicer tasting the healthy meals you make, the better you'll stick to your healthy diet. Another one is of course exercise if you're trying to lose weight and not already doing it. Mix up cardio and resistance training too, so you get the benefits of both, and try and choose some programming that you'll at least somewhat enjoy so it can be a fun hobby too rather than just a way to get back in shape. Depending on how good you are with your spending, something I think can be a great reward for sobriety is working out how much you've have spent on [x] drug in the last few months or so, and allowing yourself to put aside a small % of that to buy yourself a small gift/reward. Get something healthy/beneficial too, like something that'll get you into a new healthy hobby/further encourage an existing one, like in my case it might be something like new workout equipment etc.",1695164921.0

Benzos are somewhat subtle drugs, they can feel strong in certain ways at certain dosages, but often, and for many people, and especially with high/black out doses (I found a weird effect where with blackout doses it felt like I took 0 drugs), you can feel stone cold sober even when you're really messed up, and be unaware of it. Funny thing is I already knew this because I lived with my ex for years who'd take like 10 pills randomly when feeling bad and even though they'd have a lot of tolerance built up and could kinda keep going with their life as normal, I could totally tell that they weren't ""quite there"" in a second.

It might sound weird but the moment you start to have a panic attack, instead of trying to distract yourself or reduce the anxiety, do the exact opposite. Try to focus on the physical feelings in your body, and try to, with your mind, ""make the panic attack worse"". You should quickly find that it's futile, you can't make it worse and in fact when you really focus on the feelings in your body, they take on a more neutral appearance. Suddenly the ""heart pounding so hard I think I'm dying"" becomes ""my heart is racing"", suddenly the ""my palms are sweating so badly, what's wrong? is something happening to me"" becomes ""I have sweaty palms."" and what was an unbearable experience can become much more manageable.

k171dbu,"^(Spoilers: Day 1 in Recovery) (First of all, ignore the English mistakes, I had to get help from the counselor! I honestly didn't want us to have this experience, but if I'm going to take anything good out of it, I'm going to take inspiration from reading that someone else has achieved what I want most!) Literally, our experiences are quite similar, except that I've had problems with this for longer, and it became apparent again in covid when I stopped the main addiction I had, and that I decided to stop before the social isolation, which was alcohol. I've always gone to extremes in every area of my life, and addiction was no different: either I experimented and the drug didn't enslave me, or I became a hostage to whatever I was using, and what's worse, the progression and lack of control were already at the beginning. In 2020, in February, I decided to stop drinking, it was just the best thing in my life, but then we went into quarantine and I just didn't want to live the life I was living, so I numbed myself! I took an excess of stimulants and when my body couldn't handle so many days without sleep and the amount of drugs, I doped myself! It was then that my mother came to where I lived and suggested ""hospitalization"" as we say in my country, and it took me a week to accept, but I did. Like most things in my country, on the internet everything is perfect and in real life it's the opposite (everything is appearance), the clinic I went to literally looked like a madhouse. I won't go into details, but I managed to stay clean for 2 months and I was optimistic, I could take what the doctor prescribed. Until I was called to work there, where the therapist physically and psychologically abused me, and after many months of torture, she had bought a box of stimulants and given them to me. I had the choice not to use them, but I didn't want to. Anyway... I don't blame myself. Today I take 98% less than I used to. But it's not the dose! so if I can't stick to just two pills, I'd better reorganize myself to go without. And the one thing I agree with the most today is that we have to tell a loved one! I did that today. I'm still shaking, but it's a start. I wanted to thank you for your attention and your reports, and as silly as it may seem, it is a source of inspiration for me! Thanks for your time.",1695078012.0
k16y28z,"Thank you. Appreciate this comment. You're right about the bad day thing for sure. Yesterday was pretty rough all day (presumably from the lack of sleep) but I crashed for a solid 11 hours and although I feel tired as hell today I'm not feeling all paranoid and anxious and rough like I did yesterday. Part of my social isolation stemmed from my earlier stint with drugs. I was addicted from 2012 to the start of 2015, and when I got clean, living in a small town where I knew and used with so many people - I figured the only way to avoid triggers initially was to stop going out here. I did that and then my prior social anxiety that I had came back with a vengeance, and my social life never recovered. I've been hesitant to even do things like go to a coffee shop etc for fear of running into people I ghosted years back when I first got clean and was afraid to face those people again. But at this point I'm starting to see that I can't really just live my life in fear like that. Worst case (very unlikely) I go out and have miserable social experiences everywhere - what's to lose even in that case when I have no social life anyway. If it was really that bad I could always move town to somewhere people don't know me, but in reality I'll probably be surprised to find people from my past probably don't even recognise me now with shorter hair/more muscle etc. I suspect my PAWS is related to the GHB, and maybe also to the couple of benzodiazepines I tried to use to help me taper the GHB, because I did use a stupid amount of them in a single month period at the start of the year, and unlike the G I never tapered off those either, just went cold turkey, which presumably might have been why I had such a severe psychotic episode that landed me in hospital. But what you said about the PAWS episodes getting less common is true. I still deal with issues basically every day but instead of feeling bad and it lasting the whole day, it's started to be that I can get anxious/paranoid/feel ill for a bit, and then a couple hours later feel better. From here hopefully it'll transition to not every day, and then not every week, and so on. & thank you! I'll probably take you up on that, same for you or anyone reading this, I'm an open book and happy to make new friends and chat with anyone. It'd be nice to make more friends focused on recovery, as many of my old friends that I speak to less now are still using.",1695076619.0

So if I try to figure out why I'm fearful and address that I can avoid the emotions that follow. Typically I find there's nothing to be fearful of it was just my f-ed up mind playing games with me. 'example 1 my original post"" Your situation with your mother resonates with me as I too have mommy issues. There's nothing we can do about the past and have to let it go so we can be happy today. Some people are sick and their actions reflect that. We can only hope ""pray if it's your thing"" that they find help and get better.

k13pcaa,"I have this same problem with DoorDash. Every time I place a food order it prompts me to add alcohol and other stuff to my order, as well as the main page having entire sections dedicated to ordering alcohol sometimes. It's triggering, but thankfully I haven't really had much of a struggle from it, it's something that used to be part of my life, now I don't drink or use no matter what, I've relapsed enough times to finally know exactly what will happen if I relapse and I'm not giving up what I've gained in recovery to get loaded. I completely understand what it feels like to be tempted and to say fuck it and just impulsively sneak a drink or a drug. The alcohol industry knows exactly what it's doing, and they make too much money to care about people's well-being, but that's a different conversation for a different time. Anyways. My suggestion would be to contact the app's customer service somehow, explain, and see if they can possibly remove those alcohol suggestions from her user experience. I've never tried doing this, so I have no idea if it's even possible for them to do, but it doesn't hurt. Maybe creating a new profile altogether may help eliminate those suggestions. If it's a big enough problem, I would say it's much better to uninstall the app and find other means to get groceries and food delivered, rather than put their sobriety in jeopardy. There's plenty of other apps and services if shopping in person isn't an option.",1695027781.0
k13oer5,"We are not doctors, so don't take this as medical advice, but rather as anecdotes and suggestions. I would recommend seeing a psychiatrist rather than a general practitioner, internal medicine, family doctors, if you haven't already. GPs receive an incredibly limited education on psychiatric disorders and treatments, all they really know is ""depression=Lexapro, Anxiety=Xanax"" while there is a whole spectrum of SSRI's, SNRI's, TCA's, MAOI's, SARI's, antipsychotics, atypical antidepressants, etc. I have gone through probably a dozen different psychiatric meds for depression and anxiety, mostly for depression, after around a few months to a year they stop working for me, or ""poop out."" Anyways, I would highly recommend exercising, start slow, increase the intensity over time. It sounds cliche, but it's worked for my sister and I who both had panic disorder in the past. CBT from a therapist will also help manage these episodes in the long run. As far as medication goes, benzos are the gold standard Anxiolytics. However, as fellow addicts, I would advise to weigh the pros and cons. If you think taking a controlled substance would compromise your recovery, it's up to you to make that call. There are other options than benzos for anxiety disorder treatment. Off the top of my head, I remember taking Hydroxyzine a couple years ago for anxiety, its technically an antihistamine, but is prescribed for anxiety. There's also Gabapentin which is classified as a muscle relaxer, but is also prescribed for anxiety treatment, I also have been prescribed this for anxiety. Both generally do not result in dependence or withdrawals like benzos would, and have a lower potential for abuse as they do not produce a level of intoxication or a pleasurable high compared to benzos. Any which way, these options are generally used for acute symptoms or to immediately treat an attack. Another treatment option that is often prescribed alongside a fast acting anxiolytic are ""antidepressants"" or SSRI's which are often used for long term treatment of depression and anxiety nowadays. MAOI's and TCA's are older types of antidepressants that are still sometimes prescribed today, but are generally used if today's SSRI's and SNRI's are not effective, as they can carry more side effects and drug interactions. SSRI's are more for anxiety as well as depression and are generally the first line of treatment, while SNRI's can actually increase anxiety, but can be more effective for depression. On top of these medications, more often today are atypical antidepressants and low doses of antipsychotics used in conjunction with SSRI's, such as Wellbutrin, Rexulti, or ""California Rocket Fuel"" for examples. In my personal experience, Escitalopram and Duloxetine, separately at different times in my life, were the most effective for anxiety treatment although my main diagnosis being treated was major depression. I also had excellent results when 0.5-1mg of Brexpiprazole was added on top of an SSRI, though I noticed moderate side effects such as blunted affect, weight gain, and hyperhidrosis. Everyone is different, and researchers still don't really even know how antidepressants exactly work, just that they do, so your mileage may vary. Antidepressants don't carry much of a potential for abuse at all, as they are not traditionally intoxicating at all, and in my experience have only aided me in my recovery, if that's a worry of yours. Sorry for this massive post, I'm just a big psychiatry and drug nerd, and have an extensive history in treatment as a patient. For the record, I have 13 months clean from opioids and meth, as well as all the other shit I used - congrats on your clean time that's a huge accomplishment!!

I was caught in a cycle of abuse that was basically only interrupted by short moments of clarity. In one of those moments I confessed my problem to my closest loved one who I was hoping might help me get help. They looked up NA meetings and helped me go there. I went every week and stayed clean for about 10 weeks. For the last 9 days or so I suffered the worst cravings ever, I felt my identity threatened by getting clean. That lead to a relapse. During that relapse I really felt the emptiness, the hollowness of the experience. It was a wild ride as always, but those 9 or 10 weeks clean beforehand didn't really work to improve the trip at all. At was the same as just taking a break of 7 days. And yet, after that relapse, my body was broken down like it was in the beginning of those first 10 weeks of clean time.

k0t0fe7,"I wish there was an easy answer for how to find balance and figure out how to live after addiction. It's so different for everyone. And I definitely don't live exactly the same as I did before; I've had to rebalance everything. I've realized that there are some things that are only fun for me if I'm drunk or high. But a lot of the nightlife I loved before, I've just figured out more what parts are important to me: I'm very drawn to art and performing arts, I still love dancing, I love meeting people in offbeat spaces and hearing interesting stories. I've definitely learned how to be in touch with my own feelings more. There is a point in the night where I will have a feeling that I used to always interpret as ""time to do more \[whatever my drug is tonight\]"". But now I realize that feeling (for me) is actually ""I'm bored"". So I either change up the scene or I go home. If I'm at something like a music festival, I bring a book so I can go back to the tent and take reading breaks. I think a lot of my social drinking and drug use came from trying to push myself past my natural point of wanting to disengage. (Again this will be different for everyone). I've also found that at most of these things, there are plenty of people who are close enough to sober that I can hang out with them all night without feeling like I'm the odd one out. I always used to hang with people who were going really hard. I now have realized that at any event there's a total mix of intoxication levels. And as years go by, I find myself putting my energy into a wider and wider array of things. So the ledger of things that I don't want to ruin is always getting stacked up higher. The early parts are really, really rough. Which is why for me it really didn't click until I'd had a relapse so bad that I came to understand that it really wasn't a choice. It wasn't even ""get sober or die"", it was ""get sober or continue living in a way that will become so bad that you will not recognize yourself."" Some people don't have to get backed that far into a corner, but some do. It's really hard to be someone's friend while you wait for them to finally get there. I wish there was a way for me to explain what addiction feels like from the inside, because it's honestly just as confusing when you're living it.

I’d bounce from friend to friend, one or two at a time, to fill most of the week doing what I did, but each person was only partying once a week. But, my addiction still was growing… the amounts, my behavior, the consequences, and they were still maturing. Marriage and kids came in to play for them, and most of them would only go out every so often. I found a new group of “friends,” most folks that were just like me. I’m hindsight, we didn’t really care about each other, it just helped normalize the stupid shit we were doing as folks pushing 30. In the course of this, I drifted away from my original friend group. They’d check in, hearing rumors of my escapades through mutual acquaintances, or invite me over… which at the time, I internalized as a non-verbal admonishment for who I was… so I could check out their “picket fence” lives, complete with the happy/shiny wife, toddler running around, “important” work stuff and a couple of SUVs in the driveway. I kinda stopped picking up the phone and ignoring text messages at that point. Partly because I didn’t want to be judged (not that anyone really said anything too harsh, but just the fact that their existence was so much “better” than mine made me feel a certain type of way), but really because my use was accelerating into insanity. By this point, I was living for the high. I could still hold down a job at this point, but it was just work, getting wasted, sleep and repeat. I was losing any control over my addiction and started having too many consequences when going out (embarrassing shit, sleeping with random people, losing stuff, blackouts and the accompanying random injuries) so I also drifted away from those “new” friends. Going to work (to make money to get wasted) and being home behind a locked door, with everything I thought I needed to feel OK, was all I cared about. I know some of my friends tried to reach me during this… calling, dropping in, coming to my job… but I would just be furious at their interference. There were times, when I was out of money, or too sick to move from using, where I’d call and ask for help, even staying with someone for a few days to “clean up,” but it would be a week or two before I was right back at it. They started getting pretty sick of my shit around this point. The lies, manipulation, even stealing when I was particularly desperate. It wasn’t soon after that my addiction had progressed to the point I became unemployable. I knew things were way out of control at that point, but I could not stop. When I had to stop, whether that was jail, hospitalization or not being able to get money… I couldn’t stay stopped for any longer than a couple months… though honestly, that was usually measured in days. My original friends knew I was committing slow suicide, so they rallied, and in doing so, easily put in a thousand times more effort than I was giving. Countless nights chasing me around, looking for me, dragging me out of seedy hotel rooms, dropping me off at hospitals, detoxes and rehabs when I’d call begging for help… and even picking me up on the side of the road when I would AMA yet again from those facilities. One by one, though, they gave up. I imagine it was hard to watch… but also all the needless bullshit, stress and frustrations dealing with my pleas for help and false promises that this time I was done for good. Addicts often like to think they’re only hurting themselves, but really, we’re just too blinded by the endless cycle of craving and gratification to honestly consider anything, or anyone, else. TL:DR (and some advice): One day, you may find the person you’re looking at and talking to resembles your friend very little… and honestly, if it gets to that point they will in fact, no longer be the person you knew. They can come back from it, but there is nothing you can say, nothing you can do, no amount of love, kindness, compassion, understanding or willingness to help that will stand for a single, solitary second against the will of an addict who isn’t done yet. The only thing anyone ever did that actually helped me, was a standing offer (from the one remaining friend that would still acknowledge my existence) to help, but with clear boundaries. The offer was he would drop me off at a detox, sober house, meeting, etc.… but only if: He wasn’t otherwise busy, I wasn’t completely wasted, and that I’d have to find my own way home. My last piece of advice is simply to remember the phrase: “I can’t save you from you, but I can save me from you.”",1694814685.0

k0q3y8u,"Definitely worth my time. I'm do yoga and love yoga philosophy. I share this because there's a very similar way of looking at our thoughts, to what you've described. Non-attachment. It's the attachment to thoughts (and everything, really), that causes the suffering. I had to laugh at your ""go pound sand"" because I like to say that I tell my thoughts to 'f\ck right off."" But I never thought to take it that step further of helping someone else, or bettering myself. That is excellent advice!!!!! Take that flow of energy, which is actually neutral, but I've turned it into a negative (fear), and turn it into a positive (helping someone, even if that someone is me). Also the self-talk! When i first was trying to quit, I would say things like ""I have to/need to/should quit."" When I told a friend of mine these things, she said to tell myself ""I CHOOSE to quit."" That made all the difference. You've reminded me of the deep power of self-talk. I also started in NA and spent a couple of years in those rooms once. Took what helped me and also had to deprogram some of it. Anyway...thanks again. Really has helped me.",1694799101.0

k0p7lud,"You’re wonderful for having so much care in your heart for them. I’m recovery, a person’s sober support system is key to aiding long-term sobriety. The truth is- you can’t ever force someone to get help. I’ve found oftentimes that the harder someone is pushed by those around them, the more they resist. If they’re in the mindset of continuing to use then that might be the only place they can be for now. That’s not to say you shouldn’t voice concern or stop supporting them, but it might be good to reframe it. Let them know, “Hey, I (or we) are worried your health might get worse but I understand the need to continue doing what you’re doing. I hope you’re as safe as you can be and I’m here for you if you need something.” Maybe mention or even flat out give them some test kits to make sure their substance(s) are clean. Lots of cutting agents now, especially fentanyl and depending on where you’re at, xylazine. If you can, take some time to read into motivational interviewing. It’s not like a cure all style of talking to people, but it helps open the door to more direct and honest dialogue with people who might seem resistant. Biggest take away from that method is OARS. O- open-ended questions A- affirmations R- reflections S- summaries Just a way to talk to others and we’ve specifically found to be ideal when addressing those with substance use disorders.",1694787326.0

k0oocac,People tend to underestimate how terrible alcohol withdraw really is. They do t use and don't understand needing something everyday to feel normal. I do. I've heard liquor drinkers say swapping to a lighter and lighter beers is like decreasing your daily dose. So one week drink those 211 12% beers then a 10% a week later then 8-9% beer and keep doing this till youve worked down to a light beer. Like opiates it'll be uncomfortable but also you'll avoid beinf totally sick and my buddy who did this said it was alot easier to try quitting once you've gotten to light beers daily. I believe in realistic healing not crazy high expectations. Unfortunately your brain has a weak spot and it's booze. Knowing this gives you power back even if it dosent feel like it now. Would backing down your % every week or other be something you could manage? You have to limit your drinks also but 8-9 211 in a day will keep a decent buzz while alowwing you to back down from liquor if that's your choice. If your a wine guy you can also choose wines with lower and lower content. Hope this helps trying to cold turkey is unrealistic but bringing down your use first is alot more doable. Good luck,1694778913.0
k0oljni,"I know this sounds like I'm recommending religion, but I am not. I urge you to read some Buddhist books. I am not a Buddhist, but I was curious about this ancient philosophy because it was something I knew nothing about. I didn't understand it at all. But somewhere around the 4th book I read, it suddenly started to make sense. And, what I learned from it has seriously healed parts of me I didn't think were possible. I used to have meltdowns. I would shake and cry. It sounded like a train running through my head while also suffocating and drowning at the same time. I would get a weird feeling of electricity, tingling in my face. And I didn't think I would ever be normal. I also would get super suicidal right before I got my period. Not all the time, but a couple times a year I would do something stupid with the intent of killing myself. I was really messed up. And, my anxiety about not being able to deal with the world, my depression about not living up to my expectations for myself, and not fitting into the basic expectations about working and relationships- that was a huge source of pressure, depression, anxiety, anger, and fear. I didnt know Buddhism could help. I just wanted to learn about it because it's been around for so long and I thought it would be interesting to understand what people are talking about and understand more about who the Dali lama is and what that's about. I really didn't understand what I was reading, so I kept reading and looking for more understanding. And then one day, during the 4th book I was reading, I felt like I understood the message. And I could understand the wisdom in what I was learning. And, it kind of blew my mind that there was an ancient philosophy that described the very type of problems I had, and described a solution to them. I dont believe in a lot of the Buddhist religious part. There's a whole bunch of it that I know nothing about. But, in reading what I did, I learned about the true nature of emotions. The false sense of security that comes from attachment to our thoughts, our emotions, and our black and white thinking. I learned that my expectations about having material success was recognized as the road to suffering by philosophers thousands of years ago. And that my existence here doesn't need to be justified. We are all here equally, no matter our status or what shape our lives take. And I learned that emotions are simply information. It's not a guide or defining aspect of my reality. The same way that the engine light comes on when something is wrong, an emotion comes and provides a little information about something. But, it's not who we are and it certainly isn't a major crisis everything we get a little blinking light. Just acknowledge the information, learn from it, and move on. If correction is needed, it is your duty to correct and take right action so that no harm is happening. But, the default state is neutral. We don't need to have any emotional state at all. And we certainly don't need to hang on to or raise our emotional experience to a level of self importance that dominates our reality. The concepts I've touched on are explained much better and have much more depth and nuances than what I am able to provide. I can't tell you how transformative it was for me to learn and gain understanding from such ancient wisdom that spoke directly to the problems I'm experiencing in my life. It's really an amazing and validating experience. I urge you to go to the library or find some books online that interest you. I just picked stuff at random that seemed interesting. And I kept reading until I felt like I understood what was being said.",1694777440.0

k0oe0te,"Wow. 18 days is really good. It's the first bit that's the hardest. I used to make it about 3 months and then relapse. I felt like I was an addict and there was no ""me"" without it. And, in a lot of ways that was true. I used it to be more creative. I used the ups and downs to fuel my inspiration. I used the mind altering substances to explore my perspective. But, a lot of what I created when high is gone. I always ended up selling my stuff before it was truly complete, and for super cheap, just to keep using more. So, in truth, I never ended up making anything that truly explored my potential. And I never invested my money into developing my skills. I should have been taking art classes and dedicating time to my craft. But thats just one aspect of how my addiction was a lie. There are so many ways I thought my addiction was necessary that, in reality, was a lie and was holding me back from truly committing to following my dreams or investing in my future. I actually thought I wouldn't live past my mid 30s. But, guess what, I'm in my mid 40s and I have health problems. I seemed strong when I was younger. I didn't feel the damage from my using. I actually thought maybe the drugs were helping me stay young. Lol but no, the kind of damage it does shows up way later. And, every time I quit, it got harder and harder. Until my withdrawals became insurmountable. The last time I quit, it took me a year to even start feeling better.

Reading just a couple pages every day and trying to apply those ideas for self reflection is a good mindfulness practice. I also loved learning about Buddhism. It takes awhile to really understand what the Buddhist concepts are and how to incorporate them into my own spiritual and moral beliefs. I'm not a Buddhist, but Buddhism has really influenced me in my sobriety. I dont think I could manage it without some of the tools I learned from Buddhist texts. Making friends with sober ""normies"" who know your whole story and who accept you for who you are can also be a great tool. Don't tell people at work, and don't out yourself to someone who is toxic or can destroy you. But, you will have to take some risks. If you meet someone who could be a friend, just mention it when you are talking about yourself. Along with mentioning where you work or stuff you enjoy, you also are 7 months sober and loving it.

k0i83ki,"What's ""giving it a try"" mean to you? How much time have you ever been clean since trying any of those things? I agree that no one thing works. Detox only gets the drugs out of your system. 12 step is only good for introducing you to some ideas about how to live sober and to grow into a better person when sober. It has some intelligent ideas in it. But that's it. It doesn't actually fix anything for you. It's not like you can take it and somehow it will work. It is just good for ideas about living sober and how to problem solve as an addict that's not getting high. So, detox and 12 steps are just tools. I also use Buddhism as a tool. I'm not a Buddhist, but I found that in trying to understand the philosophy and ancient wisdom of Buddhists, I learned a lot about coping with my feelings, my objections to the world, it helped to develop my morality and helped me to get out of the cycle or depression i was in. Other tools are the people I know. I dont want people to see me high. I dont want my partner to have to deal with my addiction and all the stress. Developing sober relationships with people who know my story has helped me to feel loved and accepted for who I am. Prioritizing my health and stability is also a tool I have. I know it is hard to understand at your age. You feel invincible. I assure you, meth is not good for you. Simply raising your blood pressure like that is stressing out the delicate organ tissues like in the kidneys and in the brain. You don't want to keep doing this to your body. You won't see the results until you start to age. Then your body's overall health becomes an issue. Having damage will show up in the form of early heart disease, kidney disease, aneurysms, or more. It might not be for decades, but what you do is affecting you. Prioritizing your friendships, your health, and prioritizing gathering information to help you on your path to sobriety is the best way to use the resources you listed. None of them ""work"" on you in the way that you expect. They are just tools for helping you to make the right decisions and stay sober.",1694663704.0

So if we’re busy telling ourselves we’re worthless pieces of shit, eventually, it sinks in to our subconscious and we operate from that perspective. On the other hand, if we choose to view ourselves and our mistakes with kindness and compassion and consistently affirm our positive changes, small successes, and our goals that help us to become our better or best selves, we can operate from that place. That’s how I got clean/sober. I programmed myself to believe that I could do it with the help of others who’d done it before me. I originally did this in AA/CA, but ultimately left and then had to deprogram some of their programming that didn’t work for me.",1694657116.0

Your position in my early starting days of recovery wanting to try everything and needing to get what I thought worked best for me and this was because I was still trying to control the whole “Show” once I realized I had no control and let go of it I started to get better things were put into my life that worked and helped me because I was no longer trying to dictate my life for myself but I was now trusting in this process and letting whatever was suppose to happen happen and it’s working so far was it a easy road no it wasn’t but seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and making it out with my life and making it into full sobriety was so worth all the misery I went through to get here I crawled out the depths of hell headfirst fighting for my life to get here and you can too just let go and trust the process,1694611512.0
k0efkbh,"Provided you don’t have an undiagnosed, untreated, or under-treated mental/behavioral health issue - nothing CAN work UNTIL you truly want to stop. Steppers call that “hitting bottom.” A bottom is not a “place” like jail or homelessness. A bottom is a mental and emotional realization that “I can’t fucking live this way for 1 more second.” Some people may be in jail or homeless when they gain this perspective, but it’s the mental and emotional anguish that allows us the ability to not only ask for help and mean it, but also gives us the ability to do whatever it takes to recover. Here’s how SAMHSA defines Recovery. Recovery is: “A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential” That “process of change” will be uncomfortable. It means building a social network of people that are positive and aren’t getting high. It means dealing with your trauma. It is hard work, but you CAN do it. It’s not that therapy, outpatient, and 12 step programs won’t work for you. It’s that you may not have been willing to check your ego at the door and commit to taking whatever actions you need to take to change. Being 100% honest in therapy is a requirement for progress. The very things you don’t want to talk about are the things that keep you going back. I’m not saying that you have to go to AA/NA, but you do have to do something. There’s Smart Recovery, Refuge Recovery, Atheist 12 step groups if the god thing is a problem for you like it is for me and others. Think about your life and where you want to be. Think about the many negative consequences that your using life has given you, and how they make you feel. Understand that continuing to live the way you’ve been living can only bring more pain and misery. But also understand that your past does not condemn you to continue that suffering. Imagine the life you want to live, the best person that you see your self to be in your mind’s eye. You can be her/them. What are you willing to do to reach your full potential?",1694610701.0
k0dh0x8,"I’m glad you’re able to get them in control, alcohol and pills were the hardest things I’ve ever battled. I don’t think I would have been satisfied..in my mind anyways..to cut back to only 2-3 a day. I had the addictions, yes, but I was also battling a lot of pain from degenerative discs in my back. Surgeries helped some but it’s ongoing that Tylenol doesn’t help enough. That’s why I went the suboxone route. It helped with my cravings for the drugs but also really helps with my pain. I haven’t even taken so much as Tylenol or ibuprofen since. For me it was a lifesaver. It’s different for everyone tho. Some people want to be on it for a short time just to kick their addiction and it can be hard to wean off of alone.

k0354ww,I have a friend where he was given strong narcotics at the time he was around the 5-6 year mark.

Not standing off to the side of it”. There is also a saying “are you in the middle of the recovery boat of hanging off the side”. There are narcotics a lot less stronger than fent. That being said in the NA book it says I will not be a martyr. Meaning i will not suffer just because I am against drugs. It’s complicated.

jzzw0lr,"Honestly it sounds like I had a lot of the same problems. When I first started using it, it was sold over the counter at every head shop and people were talking about it like it was going to be this awesome drug that was like weed but didn't show up in a piss test and was legal. I had already been an addict at that point, I started with inhalants when I was about 10 and had moved onto smoking weed around 13, prior to trying spice. Once I stopped smoking it, I replaced it with a wide variety of other drugs for multiple years before I finally went to rehab and began to try and put my life together about 1.5 years ago. Today I am not what many people would consider to be sober. I smoke weed daily in moderation and use psychedelics occasionally, but I am happy and my family is happy and I am doing better than I've ever done in my life. Despite the fact that my parents did everything they could to shield me from drugs, I have always been incredibly fascinated by them from a young age and the thought of going my entire life without any of them ever again was enough to drive me to use time and time again, so I'm glad i finally found something that works for me. I grow everything myself too so the learning aspect helps satisfy my rogue craving for clandestine activities. Many people in recovery say this is not sustainable, so I don't usually talk about it on this sub cause I get a lot of hate, but that's my story in a nutshell. I have tried many substances and been addicted to many substances and spice was honestly the worst by far. The brain fog in combination with the terrible withdrawal symptoms and fiendish behavior is unlike any other drug I've been addicted to, so if you got off that you can get off anything if you want to. It sounds like you are having a hard time identifying as anything other than a drug user, and I feel that. It's something I personally feel I may have engrained in me forever, and it's just something I've gotten better at dealing with. I had to make a proactive effort to start doing better in life as well. Taking care of my health, rebuilding relationships, pursuing new career/school interests until I found a new career opportunity that takes a lot of my free time and gives me an identity. This combination of things along with a good support system has been a huge help for me personally. And the career change helped a lot.

jzywbq0,"Hi, _USERNAME_ From one internet stranger to another, I am so sorry for what you have gone through and want to encourage you that it is never too late to make a change, and \especially\ since you are A) young, B) aware of the need to change, and C) motivated to change. Your life is not ruined. I work in healthcare. Repeating what others have already said about neuroplasticity and the brain. People's brains – especially young brains – can recover from crazy traumatic things, but it takes time. My DOCs were alcohol along with other substances of varying pseudolegalities. I mention that only to show that I've been through something similar to what you're going through now. Try and find\one\ activity you enjoy doing sober – reading, music, new podcasts, horror movies, video games, baking (sugar makes for a good enough substitute addiction for some) – whatever it is for you, and give yourself things to look forward to in life. My relationship with my therapist was not perfect, but her advice to me in early recovery about “inventing things to make yourself happy” has stuck with me for years. Sometimes that's small trivial stuff, sometimes it's legitimate big stuff (trips, travel), but I needed – and I think everyone needs – something to hope for and/or aspire toward. It is probably extremely difficult to enjoy things right now or to look forward to things right now. I hope that in spite of that you can hold out the hope that there exists a way for you to live your life that is happy, sober, and enjoyable. (On therapy, you said your psychotherapy is useless right now and that's quite possible. If you haven't tried switching therapists, I'd HIGHLY recommend that. Sometimes all it takes is finding someone you have the right connection/addiction framework with.) Because you mentioned “other hard drugs” and no one else has used this phrase yet, I just want to pitch in about “harm reduction”. It sounds like right now you're 100% sober. If you are, stay that way. If you're not, and/or if you know that you're going to reach a “fuck it” point, just work on eliminating one drug at a time from your “routine”. Preferably the one with the most severe consequences in your life (medical, physical, social, psychological, whatever), but just picking one and eliminating it is a step in the right direction. If your healthcare provider isn't already providing you with something you can take for your nausea and other withdrawal symptoms, consider asking about that. Right now you're dealing with a double whammy of physical withdrawal and psychological withdrawal. If your physical symptoms can be managed, that takes a bunch of crap off of your plate for the time being. Zofran helps many manage nausea (and I can say personally that from a withdrawal standpoint it helps). Failing that, if you're unable to get OTC remedies, then if you don't know about ""home remedies"" for nausea management (and/or the other withdrawal symptoms you're experiencing), Google. I was a dude in my mid-20s and using strategies that helped pregnant women manage nausea and those tips were of big help to me. One last thing I will share is advice given to me which is that “the opposite of addiction is not sobriety, it is connection”. You shared that you want to be a better partner and engage more with your friends socially. You have people in your life who love you and want to see you well. In whatever way that looks like for you, I hope and pray that you can use those relationships as support as you climb out of this hole you've dug yourself into. You're climbing out of a hole. Your life is not ruined. Give yourself time and grace, and remember that you are loved. Feel free to reach out with anything, and I wish you the absolute best of luck.",1694356723.0

jzyiuuv,"Idk where you can access free health care in the US as I’m from Canada (and this is a prime example of why I will never live in the US), however someone suggested an emergency hospital which would provide you with immediate support - perhaps not the way you’d like it to be and let’s face the facts - you’re not going to like any of the solutions. Also, if you can afford to drink everyday, you can afford health care - I hate to say it but it’s about your priorities and realizing it’s time to save yourself - no one’s doing that for you. I think another important part of the equation is to understand that your ex is your ex for a reason - if she left you, no matter how much you may have wanted that to work out, she obviously wasn’t capable of being the person you needed her to be. And that’s ok. No relationship is ever guaranteed to last. The hardest thing I’ve had to learn is how to be my own cheerleader/best friend/hero/etc. Learning how to re-program the “self talk” that I allow in my head, such as “I’m not good enough”, or “what did I do wrong?” and instead asking questions like “what can I learn from this?” or making statements such as “I was fine before them and I will be fine without them.” Just finding the bits of goodness that I can hang onto. It’s kind of ironic to me that if I hadn’t met my ex, I would not have had the mental tools I needed to get through our break up. He gave me the tools I would later need to get through the situation he caused. I didn’t know it at the time, and it’s taken almost 2 years to come to that conclusion. For me it is especially helpful to remind myself what the good take always from the relationship are - I know how to communicate better. I know setting boundaries and sticking to them is essential to happiness. And I know that I am in control of my thoughts. That last one is an especially powerful tool to remember - that you don’t have to latch on to every single thought that comes into your head. It is possible to see through the pain and anger you feel right now. I know that’s a very difficult thing to realize and there isn’t something I can say to really help you realize this - that’s what makes this so challenging is everyone really needs to find their own way to happiness. I guarantee you if you start looking for happiness inside, you’ll find it much faster (or at least it will last much longer) than seeking it from external sources. The help is there.

When they all cut me off I bought it on the streets then added alcohol To reach the place I needed to get to. It was all I lived for, every day. I don’t even remember my daughter’s graduation, not a single thing, it breaks my heart. Drugs and alcohol were more important to me than family and friends were at that point. I didn’t want to be the person I was, didn’t want to disappoint everyone but it was a power higher than my own. Little by little I lost everyone, family and friends all gave up on me and I was alone. It wasn’t fun anymore so I tried suicide. I ended up homeless in a strange town and dropped off at a shelter. They helped me get the help I needed and I was finally ready to listen. Checked myself into rehab, got on a suboxone program and next month will be 9 years! My daughter and I finally mended things and I became a grandma 2 months ago and I’m the babysitter.

I’m currently living in a residential treatment program, going to therapy, going to daily NA/AA meetings, on methadone, on psych meds, have a recovery coach, go to daily groups and working with a ton of providers, but to get to this space I had to really want it and put in the effort to get here. It’s really hard, but when and if she’s ready she will do it. Just love her the way that is healthy for you, set appropriate boundaries and remember that it’s not a “you” problem.

I found that originally in alcohol then weed and then heroin. But it never stayed the same. the days always came that the amount I was using would not feel the same and the pain began to increase exponentially and my head started to scream and I could not shut it off no matter how much I used.

jzpy3i8,"I am very sorry you have been put through this. First and foremost, having the trauma of an addict in your family leaves lasting pain that should be dealt with by the whole family. If you are not involved in counseling, it is a very good idea. Also Al-anon is nationwide and offers support for families of addicts. They can walk with you through your healing process and give you a community of like-minded people who have been through much of what you are struggling with. For your sister, the short answer is there is very little you can do from a distance to impact her to change her life. If she has been through jails, institutions and potential death and continues to use without trying to get help, nothing you say will be able to make her change. You can continue to contact, love and support her children, as they are your family, but the sad truth is that she is not going to get sober until the consequences of her actions outweigh the benefit she is getting from the drugs. I say this as someone recovered now for nearly 17 years. Confronting her may force a temporary change, but what she needs is counseling, help and a place to get sober that will help her stay accountable and teach her how to live without her 20 year god/demon. Again, this may all sound very harsh, but you taking care of you and your parents should be the number one priority. You cannot help someone else from a position of total brokenness.",1694203406.0

jzmu7ff,"So idk if this fits in here, but I dissociate when I have panic attacks or my anxiety escalates. It happens mainly when I'm out in public whether I'm walking somewhere like a store or even a concert for 2 examples and it can happen when I'm with friends or family. But a friend of my who works in behavioral therapy suggested counting like counting how many tiles are on the floor or ceiling, or counting how many people wearing glasses or counting how many people have on sneakers or flip flops etc. Or sort of like iSpy, pick a color and look for everything around you that is that color. I've been doing it a lot lately and it helps me to stop from floating away into that dissociative place. For me, it's like I'm still here like I can see everything around me and hear it all, but I dont feel like I'm actually here as in my body if that makes any sense. I work on some of it in therapy too and I do EMDR which doesn't work for everyone and actually didn't really work for me when I first tried EMDR therapy for PTSD yearsss ago. But recently I started it up with my therapist when I had a little over a year clean, and that also has helped me a lot. I feel like my keeping myself from floating is the closest I could think of to you needing to zen yourself again, so these are the suggestions I have that worked for me that also don't require you to engage in any bodily harm. I self harmed for over a decade and the last time I did was probably 2021 and even then, it wasn't a full relapse cause I had stopped back in 2018 I think.

It's crazy! And that's not me saying by any means that the world needs to feel sorry for addicts and go ""poor addicts!"" But I definitely feel there needs to be a level of responsibility to addicts as fellow humans in need of actual help and support. Just like others struggling, addicts are struggling and cannot climb out of it completely alone. They need support, understanding and also limits. We, as addicts, have never given ourselves limits. I have said before and have heard many other addicts say ""I'm not just addicted to drugs... I'm addicted to more"". And that was me to a T as a child and up to now. Theres always this need for me that I've had and this weird, unexplainable worry that I don't or won't ever have enough of whatever. This is only a suggestion, and just like other recovering addicts that can take what they like and leave the rest, you can absolutely do the same! And idk you, but I have seen my loved ones struggle due to my decisions and I've seen it crush them and really hurt them to the point where they have PTSD and the stress took a real toll on them, so I have a care and love for you to really take care of yourself and be gentle w yourself. So I for sure agree w the other commenter above that Al-Anon or Nar-Anon is a great source of support for you to check out if you haven't already! You don't have to go, and you can always bring a close friend or family member (I would recommend not your significant other) for support as well since it would be a new place if you do go. If you like it, you can find tons of support and people who have gone through very similar situations or even identical situations as your boyfriend (I can't remember but I think you said boyfriend, if not I'm so sorry!). I think it could help you find a sense of clarity about it and feel less weight of the stress and worry! And if you don't like, I would definitely suggest finding another meeting. That's what I did when I first started going to NA meetings in my teens. I went to NA all over the area to find meetings that felt safe and comfortable for me to share and meet people. And now, I'm able to go to pretty much meetings all over and feel at home and comfortable whether I know people there or not. It's still hard, but because of me continuing to go, I proved to myself I can do it. And your boyfriend's journey in recovery is not your responsibility at all. Absolutely important that you are loving and caring and supportive, but you are also only human. With 3 years clean, I see why my family had to distance themselves from me or set boundaries. And for you, maybe the boundary can be an indirect boundary that you set for yourself. Continue to do what you've been doing, but remind yourself that he makes his own choices. And so far, it seems he's doing okay. So long as he uses his faith, his therapy, his EMDR and continues to be honest most importantly, I think he will be well off. This is not the most popular opinion I have, but I really dont think NA or AA or 12 steps has to be the only way. I know that FOR ME it works and it's the only thing that has worked. But I have seen some other people do it using their faith along with therapy and family and friend supports. It is absolutely possible. For him, that is his program and if it's working, then that's good! If it's not broke, don't fix it ya know? Good idea to just keep an eye out for any signs. Try not to overreact if you notice anything strange. Maybe talk with him and do check-ins once a week and remind him you're there for him and that he can talk to you. But I think its a good idea for the next few days or week or whatever you prefer that you are with him when the kids are hanging out with him. Just a precaution. It's nothing against him. It's just to help keep some of that stress off him and it could be great family time. Sorry for the very long message, but I learned one addict helping another is without parallel and as corny as it sounds, it's so true! And even if you're not an addict, you've been deeply affected by one and are still connected to one. So I just wanna do whatever to send all the good energy and care that I've gotten through my program toward you and your family! 🥰",1694148495.0

Even my dad is like oh well he's not an addict anymore that's in the past. I wish it were that simple. And it's okay you dusted yourself and came back stronger than ever that's all you can do.

jzmca0p,"I'm so sorry. No one should ever be treated that way. Substance use disorders are chronic illnesses, and like many other chronic illnesses, such as hypertension or diabetes, can be effectively treated with the assistance of medication. Medication assisted treatment (MAT) combined with psychosocial counseling, is one of the best ways for people to get into, and stay in, active recovery. I know you're going through a lot dealing with this ignorant pile of human shit that calls himself a judge, but never lose sight of the fact that you've accomplished something monumentally difficult by getting yourself into active recovery. That's a massive accomplishment that you should be very proud of. I hope you find justice for yourself and any other victims of this disgraceful ignoramus. The kind of bigoted opinions this asshole spewed all over you are directly responsible for people not getting the help they need. No one should ever be judged for getting sick, and that's precisely what this asshole is doing.

jzm6s6v,"I’m 13 days sober from everything (except coffee, social media, and my prescribed adderall) today. God it hurts but I’m so proud of myself. I had a series of bad trips on 3-4 different hallucinogens this summer and realized they weren’t serving me anymore. The final straw was taking some mushrooms and Molly at a club while drinking, leaving to go see the sunrise, and vomiting everywhere and being unable to move even my head or barely breathe. I decided right then and there to never look back. Acid used to serve me and helped me get through some trauma but it no longer did anymore. (I took it max once or twice a month at my worst, for raves.) basically all of the hallucinogens that used to make me feel free and happy instead had me crying and begging to the Universe alone in the woods or at festivals for a radical change and a deep reset. Turns out I have to at least control this part of my universe, and be the change I so badly needed.",1694138642.0

It it was so helpful that I have use full doses of psilocybin a few times. I did more helping in I trip than I had in 10 yrs in recovery with counselors, meetings, groups etc. Everyone is different/unique. But there are many successful medical studies done on the benefits of psychedelics for SUD, depression, PTSD dating back to the 50/60s before the war on drugs propaganda.

jzlxc5v,"I can’t talk you off the ledge. You got yourself out there you have to bring yourself in. What I can do is tell you how to do what worked for me when I was feeling the same way you are. The difference between today and 5 days ago is want. Until 5 days ago you wanted to stay sober, but now you want to relapse. Want is the root of all suffering. It’s why you are suffering now. You have to change your thinking back to wanting to be sober. But how do you do that? You do that by remembering all the reasons you wanted to quit to begin with. All those reasons are still there. If you relapse, you’re not going back to square one, you’re going to square zero, the abyss that is addiction. Relapse sucks. It’s just like falling back into active addiction but with the added guilt of having let yourself down, let the.people who care about your recovery down. That weighs heavily on you and it doesn’t matter how much you use that feeling doesn’t go away. Don’t have anybody that cares about your recovery? I don’t even know you and I care about it. I suspect you have a sub full of people here who care about it. Active addiction sucks. You feel terrible most of the time. It’s this endless loop of use and feel ok (you don’t even feel good anymore, you use so much that high just feels normal), feeling like death on the comedown and withdrawals, trying to figure out where the money for next fix is coming from, lie/cheat/steal to get the money for it, and go pick up. Is that the life you want to live? Lies your addiction will tell you… “One more time won’t hurt.” It will, there’s no such thing as “one more time.” It always leads to more. “But it will be different this time.” It won’t. It will be the same but worse because you’ve had a taste of sobriety. “But we have it under control now! Look how long we quit!” You don’t. You just don’t. Trust me on this. Addiction is a progressive disease. It only gets worse, never better. Learn to recognize your addiction’s voice and shut it down as soon as you hear it. This has gotten long so I’m going to be short with the rest of this. Don’t dwell on thoughts of using or relapse. Push them out of your head as soon as they come in there. Actively hate your addiction. It has ruined your life long enough. Don’t do anything that’s not good for your sobriety no matter how much they pressure you. Don’t glorify how great getting high was, remember how bad the suck was that came with it, remember all the reasons you hated being an addict. When the thoughts of using or relapsing start, get up and get busy doing something that occupies your mind and your body until they pass. That’s enough for now. Those are the tools I used when I was struggling to help bring me in off the ledge. I hope there’s something in there that’s useful to you. Congrats on 5 months. That’s a huge accomplishment. You’re doing great, now just keep it going. Come back in a month so we can wish you happy 6 months.",1694134801.0
jzlwufk,"I believe the last time I had sedation dentistry for a dental implant, I asked them after what drug(s) they used for the sedation and one of them was Fentanyl. I was like “whaaa?” knowing it’s reputation. So I think it’s common. I also want to say that after a laparoscopic surgery, a few years back, I was in tons of pain. Too much. What really ended up helping (far more than Percocet or Vicodin) was alternating Ibuprofen and Tylenol. When I stayed on the appropriate dosage & schedule my doc recommended, the pain was very manageable. Also never underestimate the importance of ice packs.

jzlpvg8,"I had a HORRIBLE ear infection over a holiday — went to the ER for help because I was in the most pain I had ever experienced and I have a high pain tolerance. Doc ended up prescribing literal morphine for my pain, which I did take because of how severe my pain was& the fact I wouldn’t be able to see a specialist for my ear infection as it was over the holiday. I was able to use the morphine to get through the pain I was in, but it didn’t cause me to relapse. Previously I used opiates but they were never my DOC, so that could have some effect too but I’m still in my sobriety and very proud of that! I also feel good that I sought the treatment I needed (even though the doctor was weird to give me morphine because that has such a HIGH abuse potential). Anyway, I’m trying to say that NO — this does not necessarily mean your significant other will relapse!

jzlkuyq,"recovered addict fresh off a dental surgery i was KO’d for hours for month ago or so. Did I notice a VERY SLIGHT “sum sum” like super small headspace change/relaxation/warmth? yes. But I almost immediately passed back out in the car anyway the entire ride home and the feeling was VERY short lived and it was not “enjoyable” in any way for me as I was still in pain. It’s more of an “Oh man I’m out of it!” sorta thing, which u definitely are as you start to wake back up. After that its nothing really. Having my DOC be Fentanyl and Benzos, being KO’d scared me. All said and done I DID NOT get ANY urges to relapse, change in my thoughts or an increase in drug dreams, no triggers, nor any sort of “set backs” physically or mentally. It definitely DID NOT have any negative effects. All of this said, you should still make sure he has his “tools” available to him and not do anything to trigger him. By tools I mean access to his sponsor if he went that route, or his meditation tools, or MMJ (some despise that this is a tool others use but naturally I see it as who am I to judge others as an addict, what works for them works. Also i am one lol), or his “recovery soundtrack” aka music that helps, whatever he does for help. Ofcourse I assume you also know his triggers or atleast the obvious ones, as some are just general and others are very very personal. Like if he struggles around his mom, dont bring him around her for a couple days. He should be A-OK! I’m SHOCKED they didn’t offer you an alternative however. They have many other drugs an Anesthesiologist can use to KO you for surgery. You might be in more pain after, but you can totally make it work. People who are on Suboxone and Sublocade ((both contain Opiate Blockers and cause precipitated withdrawal (immediate w/d when opiates are used)) and one is even an injection lasting over a month so you can’t NOT be on it, they still get surgeries done. They clearly should have done that with him, treated it like he was on MAT. If you want to avoid this issue ever again, you can make sure to tell your insurance and health network/care provider (even a Dr works if you say please out it in my records) that you (he would do this) are an opiate addict and need it to be reflected in your medical records and care so that you do not run into any unforeseen issues. It’s like crazy hard to get removed once it’s on and he’ll NEVER get opiates again, but it will work.",1694129682.0
jzlflnx,"Here's another one of my anecdotes regarding me and my wife and our recovery: My girlfriend (now wife) and I were both heavily addicted to opiates and benzos for several years until we got clean in March 2018. My wife got pregnant about 3.5 years after we got clean, and she subsequently told the doctor that she didn't want any narcotics when she gave birth. Last June, my pregnant wife developed pre-eclampsia, which required her to have a C-section just under two months from her due date. She refused Lorazepam before the actual operation, and everything went well, with no panic attacks or whatnot. After the successful procedure and after the drugs that were given her to 1 lower body had worn off, the doctor visited the recovery room and again offered IV Dilaudid or oxycodone. My wife was obviously in a whole hell of a lot of pain, and the fact that she hadn't requested painkillers aside from ibuprofen up until that point was impressive. I suggested to my wife that IV Dilaudid might be a bit risky, considering how much more powerful it is compared to oxycodone. The doctor gave her oxycodone which definitely helped a lot. I'm pretty sure they would've given her something regardless of her agreement because of the risk of high blood pressure caused by the pain and pre-eclampsia. Anyway, my wife was on oxycodone for one week in the hospital following the C-section and two weeks after getting discharged. I never even considered taking one of her meds, and she took them as directed for the duration of the prescription. She hasn't had any opiates since then. I'm so proud of her for going through that and not relapsing. Now we have a happy daughter with both of her parents continuing to be clean and functional!",1694127589.0

jzhr0dl,"""I need to stop doing drugs."" Yeah, you're correct here. I'm a big believer in what addiction physician Gabor Mate has to say on the matter though, which is basically, ""figure out what the drug is doing for you."" The drug use is just a symptom of something underneath the surface. Why are you using? For most people it's trauma, alienation, isolation, or loss of purpose. Sometimes combinations of all of those. In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts is Dr. Mate's book on addiction, it really helped change things for me. Even if you don't buy it, try watching some of his talks. On a concrete level. You need to get rid of the contact info of any dealer or source. Even if they're friends. You will crave again and you're putting yourself at great risk if you have easy ability to pick up. I know you said you hate religion, but I think you could really benefit from mindfulness, including mindfulness meditation. It honest-to-god (funny place for that phrase, sorry) doesn't have to be religious in the slightest. It's your own mind, after all. You can learn to watch your thoughts, including your cravings, and let them pass...which they always do. This is very powerful. If the Buddhist angle doesn't turn you off, Dharma Recovery is a non-religious recovery meeting that relies on Buddhist psychology. Otherwise there are SMART meetings as well. You should drop by your local addiction recovery center. I found out that mine offers you a free recovery coach, with whom I now meet regularly! You say that you have no personality. I am currently going through something similar myself. What I happened upon is the concept of The Dark Night of the Soul, in which you enter a period of deep, existential crisis in life. Who you were must die so that you can be reborn into something different. Perhaps you never had a strong personality, or perhaps your old personality has undergone a long and tortuous death. Maybe there isn't much left, but if you come from a place of sobriety and intentionality, you can actually craft a new personality, whole cloth. Again pulling some from Buddhism, I've found simple values such as loving kindness, forgiveness, and acceptance to be ready-made grounding principle on which to build up myself and others. Your brain will undergo miraculous changes if you give it a chance. My memory, word-finding, idea formation, and emotional control has all improved so much, even with occasional relapses over the year. It's easy for me to say this after turning a bit of a corner, but rock bottom might be a really good place for you to be. Just like The Dark Night of the Soul, the experience is extremely painful to endure, but it is ultimately a necessary step for you to move onward and grow.

jzfkvws,"What kind of support group do you have? Do you go to any meetings ? Do you share all this with anyone in recovery in whom you can trust ? There are a shitload of clichés I remember from early recovery and one of 'em that's always held true is, ""If you hang around the barber shop, sooner or later, you're gonna get a haircut."" Stop hanging around folks who are actively using and hang with people who are also working on recovery and self-improvement. Try some volunteer service so you can give something back and see others who may have it worse than you, which is important for gratitude. Also, too, regularly write gratitude lists and fear lists. Gratitude lists will help to keep you centered and fear lists will point out just how neurotic many of us can be with regard to fear, which is always future-based. If finding people to hang with is not possible, just go to the library and enjoy the silence. Now would be a great time to start journaling.

jzfi8zm,"agree here. the only thing id add is you CAN still get and stay clean if someone else points out to you these issues but ONLY as long as you DESPERATELY want that too and will do anything to achieve it. For example my rock bottom wasn’t flatlining or jail or anything typical. It was losing my friends and loved ones. They wanted me to quit for years n id lie or cut back to appease em etc 24/7 but one day they all decided “nope were gone. don’t call don’t text etc unless its to say u got clean. Friends completely stopped answering or riding with me to school even and my parents stopped talking entirely to me. I was utterly alone. I decided I hated this and this life wasn’t worth it and tried that route but got narcan by parents, they recorded it tho.. made me watch.. scared tf outta me (had already had 11 od’s.) then they said were never doing this again.. and waked out. I started cutting back heavy because besides Opis I was on Benzos which you can’t just stop or you can die. Once I got real low (I DO NOT recommend this because this is NOT going to work for all or most) I decided to sit in my room and trip on mushrooms. I had the worst scariest most eye opening experience of my life. Not like “oo scary ghosts” stuff, like a realization I was a failure, and a junkie with no friends and drove away everyone who ever loved me, ruined the lives of those I cared deeply for, etc etc, and ALL OF IT was because I was in love with POISON that was going to kill me. I had done everything I swore Id never do as a kid or teen. (I was IV w my opis as well btw) so I decided thats it im gunna do this last one here just to stay “well” (not withdrawal) and i would snort it insteada IV so i wouldn’t get high, and I flushed the rest. When I woke up I BEGGED my parents for another chance at Rehab. Next day I was otw to Florida to a dual diagnosis facility where I got clean, learned alot (mostly about myself), and basically owe my life to. Basically you can say others made the decision for me which in turn caused my rock bottom, or they just happened at very similar times. I’m almost 5 years sober now from everything but Alcohol. I’m one of the VERY VERY few lucky enough to be able to casually drink still and have just a few beers when with friends. Luckily I don’t need to get drunk or even drink at all, im almost indifferent to it, and will only do so mabey once every few months. I also am one of few again, (more are able to do this than alcohol as when used correctly it helps tremendously with w/d and cravings and is even sometimes prescribed for addiction) able to use MMJ, which helped me get through muscle spasms, insomnia, lack of hunger, INTENSE anxiety, rebound anxiety, and Panic Disorder, pain but not able to take pain meds, and cravings etc etc etc. Now I have little to no cravings except when experiencing a Panic Attack.",1694031802.0
jzfdwkt,"good site for finding groups like AA/NA groups if they work for you. Otherwise SMART recovery is good as well. Also online forums can help like places on here, a therapist, or even an addiction specialist. It’s all gunna depend on how YOU deal with everything best and what works for YOU. For example I HATE NA but Im 4-5 years sober finally meanwhile people are getting high in the NA parking lot so i quit going. You want a good group your comfortable with so try lots of places. Everywhere and Everyone is different. Before I was fully addicted (about ur spot it sounds like) I stopped by just staying away and deleting phone numbers. It was annoying n hard but it lasted a week max. I eventually fell back tho because drugs became socially acceptable by me when they weren’t before and I no longer needed to look for those numbers I deleted or jump thru any hoops to get them and no one would care if I used them as long as I shared or had an excuse. Thats when I got bad again n needed IOP (Intensive Outpatient Program) then soon PHP (Partial Hospitalization Program) then they got closed down (awful facilities so keep that in mind when looking for places) and I went back into messing up but harder n harder each time so next trip was to full blown Inpatient Rehab Facility. Luckily for me it ended up being a dual diagnosis facility meaning that had full staff of mental health professionals as well and could diagnose/treat those issues too. This was HUGE for me as I learned I had several issues like ADHD, PTSD, Panic Disorder, n Depression that were ALL fueling my addiction, and were the reason I wanted to “shut off” or “numb” my brain or myself, and when these issues were worked on and addressed, it made treating the addiction SO much easier. (Cuz yes drugs are fun n i liked that n miss that but it was a bigger reason than JUST BOREDOM for me using them even tho I wasn’t aware until then.) Definitely keep that in mind, underlying issues. Not saying it’s the reason for everyone but most have atleast some, even though we chalk it up to boredom every time.",1694030356.0
jzernhb,"lots of people here gave great advice. another way to hold urself accountable IF AND ONLY IF you don’t trust urself, is to tell a PC or pyschiatrist etc, anyone u see frequently. They’ll start drug testing u with lab tests which are hard to beat. I personally was forced to do it like this but thats because I was full blown addicted and NA isn’t for me and the outpatient i was at shut down. ONLY DO THIS IF YOU CANNOT STOP ON YOUR OWN THOUGH, as it will stay on your medical record and you WILL be treated slightly differently from then on by judgy doctors (not the good ones) and not given certain meds (like uppers or dissociatives) If you plan on working on it Yourself, start slow and take it day by day. Spend less $ and get less each day cutting back, then cut whole days out, etc. Luckily your not fully physically addicted yet or anything like that (based on your wording) and it seems more mental so if you can stop now, DO YOUR BEST TO DO SO. It will ONLY GET HARDER. Replacement therapies can work as well! For example Caffeine over Coke. IF you stop before becoming a full blown addict (no offense I’m a recovered one) you can then atleast still have fun OCCASIONALLY once your under control after a few years.

jzcyb1t,"I relapsed after a few months of sobriety and used 3 times in a 5 day period. I overdosed all 3 times. The last OD nearly killed me- in fact, there is no medical or scientific explanation for how I’m alive right now typing this to you. One of the sheriff’s deputies who helped save my life during the last 2 of those overdoses said to me, “do you know that your life has value? Because it does.” I’ve never forgotten that. And I’ve never touched heroin again. I just celebrated four years of sobriety at the end of August. All of the things I didn’t dare let myself even hope of one day having, I have them now. I’ll end this with the same thing one of the paramedics told me when they wheeled me into the hospital from the ambulance. She leaned down and said quietly in my ear, “I’ve been where you are. I hope you make it to the other side. It’s so beautiful here. Good luck. Take care of yourself.” ❤️",1693994998.0

jz6d6rq,"Here's my $.02. Write the dates down now, and use whichever one works for you now. If it helps to think of yourself as having more time, use the earliest date for now. Right now whatever keeps you from going ""well, it's not all that much time to lose anyway, what's another quick little relapse going to hurt?"" That thought process is your enemy. In the future, you may get enough time and change of perspective under your belt where you might eventually feel strange about the earlier date, because you weren't really without the influence of significant mind or mood altering substances. If that happens you might choose to go with a later date where you were completely sober because that might feel more honest or genuine to you. Or you might not. You might feel totally comfortable with the original date. For example, I had my last drink or drug that I took under my own free will on 10/10/12. So I count 10/11/12 as my sobriety date. But for the first week I was on a prescribed drug in rehab that was keeping me from getting DTs for my own safely. Now, some people historically have absolutely abused that drug I was prescribed. And if I took it recreationally I personally couldn't consider that absolutely sober. But since it was prescribed, different than my usual substance of choice, and never had any effect on me other than keeping me from having seizures, I never had any issue with keeping that original date. It really does just come down to whatever actually feels the most helpful to you at any given movement, and being ok with adjusting that should it no longer be helpful. That includes possibly coming to a point in your recovery where you stop counting and not caring about a date. Because a lot of people who have been sober for a lot of time choose that route as well. The only wrong answer is the one that isn't helping you live longer.",1693878455.0

I was surrounded by so much support and understanding in rehab, and you will find people in sober living who understand your struggles too. The structure they provide to hold you and others accountable really helps. My only complain is that it has prevented me from getting laid (fuck the curfew) but it really has prevented me from relapsing. There were times I really wanted a drink but if I failed those random UAs I’d be back on the streets. Before you leave, as to see an MD to see if they can give you some meds for anxiety, like gabapentin (careful with this one, it can be very addicting -luckily not for me- and it’s affecting my sight so I’m gonna see my primary care physician on Tuesday) vistaril, seroquel, busperone.

jyypdie,"NA has an IP called The Triangle of Self-Obsession _HYPERLINK_ that has helped me immensely. Specifically, there's a little table that talks about positive & negative aspects in relation to past, present & future. Coming from a fucked up family, I had no idea what ""faith"" in the future even meant. All I ever knew was fear. So what I learned from this little table is that, if I'm in fear, I'm in the future. And as an addict, I have no business being in the future. If/when I can stay in the present, I'm okay. It's just sometimes getting to that tiny place in the present that provides me a sense of safety and security. As for fear, there's never a tiger about to rip out my throat, nor is there a terrorist with a suicide vest, running directly at me. No, my fears are in my head and only in my head.

jyp5t73," First and foremost, congratulations on your journey to sobriety. What you've accomplished is no small feat, and it speaks volumes about your strength and determination. It's completely understandable to feel the way you do after such a profound life change. Remember, when you remove substances that have acted as coping mechanisms or forms of escape, it's like you're resetting your brain's chemistry and learning to navigate emotions in their raw, unfiltered state. Recovery isn't just about abstaining from substances, but also rebuilding one's sense of self and purpose. Over time, as you continue to heal, your brain and body will adjust. Many individuals in recovery find that their passion, creativity, and zest for life gradually return, often in ways they never anticipated. A few suggestions: 1. Professional Counseling: It can be incredibly beneficial to have someone guide you through your feelings, provide coping strategies, and help you reframe your thoughts. 2. Mindfulness and Meditation: These practices can help ground you, alleviate anxiety, and provide clarity. 3. Physical Activity: Even a simple walk can help boost endorphins and improve mood. 4. Engage in New Activities: Exploring new hobbies can reignite passion and creativity. Please remember, every journey has its ups and downs, but the human spirit is incredibly resilient. Continue reaching out, seeking support, and being kind to yourself. You're not alone in this, and brighter days are on the horizon. 🌅💜🌱",1693591237.0

jynahie,"Well, it’s complicated because I struggled with coke for longer than that. I started using occasionally in the beginning of 2015, and six months later I was deep down the hole already. It escalated until early 2016, when I got an amazing job and seriously decided to quit. I stoped cold turkey for a few months, but the job was super stressful and I started using again. And I was also having a terrible problem with a violent relationship. I relapsed hard and in two weeks I saw myself calling in sick, skipping meetings, using on a weekday afternoon, having mid-week benders. I lost the job and it was my wake up call. I broke up with the bf, and decided to stop coke. This was mid 2016. I got three months clean, relapsed hard again. That’s when I decided to get help. I got clean for the most of 2017, relapsed again. During 2018 and 2019 I got back to using “party only,” very moderately, I though it was doing no harm but today I see it was still very damaging to my mental health. In 2020, during the lockdowns, I went on a couple of overnight benders and almost slipped back into addiction, for real. It was in 2021 that I promised myself to really get my shit together and never touch coke again. So I started to over drink and over eat, and l had to deal with that… I’m telling you all of this to contextualize that recovery is a winding road, the progress we make is not linear. We keep evolving. Sometimes we take one step forward and a few back. And most of the time we deal with other problems, such as work stress, relationships, bills to pay. I never stoped being a fully functioning responsible adult, I was delivering work, caring for my boy, living my life, I got myself a condo at the beach a few years ago! But I still struggle inside from time to time. Everybody does. You have to learn to put the pain in the back burner and keep going. There are days that you wake up tired, but you have to keep going. You don’t get to do only what you like, you know? The secret is to keep going. I kept moving forward all this time, I had a few bumps on the road but never gave up. So don’t give up. You will feel better. My feel good tool is sunlight. I take long walks in the sun every chance I have. Eat well. Exercise. Sounds cliche but it really is a mood boaster. If you don’t have someone to talk to already, get a therapist. Therapy goes a long way. Focus on your work, get a hobby out of your comfort zone (learning something new is good to pump up your brain), go out in the sun, drink water, eat more fruits.

jy9fadm,"How long does it take to get arousal back after a 4 week binge ? Im a 46 year old female . I never was addicted to meth . I’d let myself do it one weekend a year , if that . It had been a year since if done it . I liked it too much to let myself do more . But my husband and I decided to do some together from mid June to mid July . Mainly on weekends . But we’d either swallow a crumb or take a puff or 2 during the week to get through work , then binge on the weekends of those 4 weeks . I went from having no sex drive in my every day life , but could have orgasms easily during sex , to now having a sex drive , but I’m numb from the waist down . How do I heal from this and get my pleasure back ? The only good that came from it was us resolving some issues and me getting my drive back. But now Im numb from the waist down ! What a cruel joke ! Up til this binge , I’d never even gotten aroused on meth . I couldn’t figure out why my husband would obsess over sex on it . He’d ask if I felt tingly down there and of course I didn’t. Til the last week we did it . I finally got horny on it . But by that time , he had painful meth balls and his junk didn’t work . Still , we managed to have some amazing sex . Sadly, the orgasms wouldn’t come while on it . That’s was another cruel joke . To be so aroused that you feel like you could orgasm from a mere touch. But nope , just hours of feeling like you’re going to with no release . I find that extremely frustrating and end up in agonizing pain from tensing up for hours trying. Anyway, is there hope for me ? I’m the past , when I’d do meth , I’d want no part of sex but the days after would leave me sensitive and horny as can be . Then I’d go back to normal . Not much drive , but could orgasm and enjoy sex and wonder why I didn’t want it more often. Now I’m all willing and wanting. But can’t feel a darn thing . My husband is amazingly skilled too . Sorry. I’m writing a book. Can someone please help me ? I can take delta 8 gummies and it helps me get aroused and orgasm . But I hate the way they make me feel.

Loss doesn't get easier the longer we stay in recovery; we just learn how to use the tools recovery has given us to get through it without going back out. A former sponsor of mine went back out after having been clean for quite a number of years and never made it back to the rooms. Another VERY close friend of mine died (clean) as a result of his 22-year meth career; he was in the doctor's office for a checkup and died of a massive heart attack. He was almost two years clean and had a VERY strong program. Both deaths happened 3 months apart. It was a hard time for me. With regards to your question, you have to learn that there's only so much you can do for people; they will get clean if/when the decide to. You can help lead them to recovery, but you can't make them use the tools. As _USERNAME_ said, you have to acknowledge your powerlessness over their disease and do the best you can for you.

jy3g9ox,"Sorry, I was projecting a bit there… that comment was something that was told to me after Demetreos had passed. I also didn’t like it much when it was said to me, but in my case, I was really feeling quite sorry for myself and in hindsight, that comment helped me snap out of thinking about how much I was in pain and instead of just being hurt, angry with him and/or blaming myself for not doing more, to also realize that there honestly was nothing anyone could or should reasonably have done. It also helped me get off of my pity pot, focus on the great things about my friend and use those things to honor his memory and the love I was blessed to be a part of. To share the good in him, that he taught me, with others. To transform his passing from a standard “unfortunate tragedy” and being reduced to a statistical notation of yet another addict overdosing… into something that I hope continues to give who he really was actual meaning.

jy3ac86,"You know you couldn’t have done anything more, and moreover, this tragedy is really about her struggle and not yours. I do know how much it hurts, though. One of my closest friends (a brother from another mother as it were) also died from an OD some years ago. Demetreos “Jimmy” Asprakis was nothing short of the one of the most wonderful men I have ever had the honest blessing to encounter. I had known him for some time, but had lost touch (with him and everyone else) when I started relapsing. He’d still meet with me when I had a particularly bad run and called him for help. He’d sit and talk with me, offer to take me somewhere to get help, and when I would decline or just ask for money or food, he’d tell me he’d be glad to if I went and got help first. I stopped calling him after a few times of this as I found his “preaching” annoying, but when I was finally done and willing, and didn’t know where to go next, I called Demetreos. He helped me so much when I came back in… using that same compassion he offered to so many other struggling men. He was there for me when no one else would, and offered me his friendship when everyone else was (rightfully) done with my bullshit. He had 2 years clean and sober at that time and got me as an indigent (I was homeless) into the halfway house he was managing. For those first few, frightening months, he supported me, cared for me, and introduced me as “his friend.” He was firm in his suggestions of what I should do to remain sober, but also treated me with compassion, love and understanding. He knew I was still hanging on to a bit of misplaced pride, so he’d go out to eat and bring me home a portion of his meal (conveniently set aside before he even started eating) and tell me he really hadn’t been that hungry. He’d buy a pack of smokes, take a couple out, give me the rest of the pack and tell me he was trying to quit. He gave me “old” clothes (I had nothing left when I came back in) that strangely had tags on them and were way too big for him. And something that seems like it would be a minor thing, but was actually so important to me… He gave me an old white Velcro wallet with a dolphin on it. I had nothing really to put in it, but he put some inspirational sayings and quotes in it and gave it to me. I had lost my wallet on my (hopefully) final run, and when I received that Velcro wallet from him.. there was something about just having one that somehow allowed me to feel like maybe I could be a “real person” again. When I finally got a job, he drove me to a nearby McDonalds every morning (he started work about 2 hours earlier than I did) and gave me a dollar or two for a breakfast sandwich. He helpfully suggested I use that time to think about my recovery and work on my steps and recovery, and I did. There are just so many great things about Demetreos and I could easily go on for another 50 paragraphs… sadly that could easily have been hundreds more, if he had lived. 2 years into my own recovery, Demetreos signed up for a medical trial for an illness he had. It was hard on him physically and he started making sacrifices in his spirituality and recovery so he could continue more easily with school and work, as he didn’t have the energy or time for both. We spoke about it occasionally and said he understood the slippery slope he was on, but felt he could manage until the trials were over. I don’t know exactly when it happened, but he relapsed. Months went by and now, it was me meeting with him when he would ask for help. I watched him deteriorate and change and I so much wanted to rescue him from the grips of addiction. We’d catch up every once in awhile, sometimes he was newly sober, others not so much. Finally, it seemed he was back on a good track. We started hanging out more, and he seemed lighter, happier and more like his true self than I had seen in ages. I remember one day, after proposing to my now wife, I excitedly called him to ask if he would be the best man at my wedding. He never picked up, so I left a voicemail. I never spoke to him again. For the next few weeks, I’d occasionally ask people we knew for any news or about him and what he was up to, figuring I’d wait for his inevitable phone call for help… but one day the “news” was simply that Demetreos, my friend, my brother, had overdosed and died. It was utterly devastating… but he had given so much of himself to me. Taught me, helped me, loved me when no one else should, could or would. Demetreos still lives on in my life and my actions to help others as he helped me. That part of him he freely gave to me that I try to freely give to others, to help spread and share the essence of his wonderful, beautiful love that shall never die for as long as it ripples through this world. I love you brother, and I miss you so fucking much. But I’m gonna keep on trucking for as long as I can… when I feel like I can’t do it for me, I do it for you… and I’ll catch you on the flip.",1693231496.0

That’s why you immediately wanted more benzos and your coke cravings are becoming unbearable. You have to resist caving to the cravings.

They should help you create perspective in your daily life that aims to match those goals and values. But if you still feel inclined to try to figure this out for yourself (no judgement: I did the same for years), I don’t see much benefit. Whatever route you go, I hope you find some kind of clarity.

Secondly, I reflect on the reasons I got into recovery to help reinforce why I am staying away of that past addiction and surround myself with my community that loves and supports me. And lastly, I redefine me what fun is for me. Fun for me is being present with my wife, family and friends and remembering all we did the night before together. Fun is being involved in the lives of those I care about. Fun is living life in a way I can respect and appreciate what I’m feeling and having a better concept of how to deal with what’s in my control and what’s not.

jxvujpi,"Look (wo)man, I was a military police officer from 18-23 until I 100% medically retired from the Army. Then I was an opiate (heroin), meth, and crack addict from 23-30. Military police to junkie was a hell of a ride. I got arrested at 28 ish and got locked up in the same (small) county jail that my mom worked at as a Correctional Officer. I was suffering myself, felt like I was just waiting to die. I didn't have a purpose in life since I couldn't do law enforcement anymore. I knew I wanted to help people but with no college degree or any discernable skills, there wasn't much to do other than shitty minimum wage jobs. At 29, I decided to give school an honest try. I started working on my Associates degree and figured I'd find some type of calling. I took an intro to social work class thinking that would be cool. I eventually applied to the University of Illinois, knowing that I wasn't really good enough to be there. I figured, at least when I got denied, I could have someone/something to blame for why I couldn't get my shit together. To my surprise, they accepted me for the Bachelor's degree program in social work. I did 2 years there, all the while looking over my shoulder waiting for someone to come in and pull me out of class realizing that I wasn't supposed to be there. I ended up doing my internship at the treatment center that denied my treatment when I needed help. I walked the stage in December in 2022 and gave our commencement speech. I started the Master's degree program in January of this year and I'm planning on graduating from that in Summer of 2024. The moral of my story is that it's never too late. For the first time in my 34 years of life, I have a job helping people,just as I intended when I became an MP. Also, it's the first job I've EVER had that I didn't wake up thinking ""Fuck... I've gotta work today."" There's a lot to be desired at my agency, as it's for-profit and very dysfunctional. But I love my job. For the first time in my life, I love my job and I'm more grateful than ever that I got my shit together.",1693087706.0

jxuanta,"I was staunchly atheist and that kept me at arms length from AA for quite some time. However, I later found it’s fairly uncommon to encounter someone who has no beliefs whatsoever in anything related to a “Power.” Many people operate (to varying degrees) on beliefs that aren’t really logical and are at least somewhat based on “magic.” Superstitions and Karma are the most common “illogical beliefs” among those that ascribe to not have a particular belief in anything other than pure logic. I never did the mirror or ladder stuff, but I had my own superstitions (without realizing it) like: Hearing “our song” on 3 different radio stations back to back on the way to my girlfriends house is not a sign we are meant to be. For Karma… Stealing that chair because the cashier forgot to ring it up is not why it broke 3 months later. Now, I still don’t like organized religion and it took me a long time to stop completely discounting the value of a share when someone simply mentioned Jesus… but, I eventually found my own belief in my own conception of an “Invisible sky wizard” that works for me. Something that helped me was when my sponsor talked to me about things like: Science itself has shown that simply watching people being helpful to others can lift people’s moods. Why does an specific arrangement of sound waves elicit the ability to make you smile or cry? How is it than running tiny electrical impulses through a pile of meat can somehow make thoughts and an individual personality? Why do we sleep? Science doesn’t know other than some hypotheses… but those don’t fully explain why we die if we don’t sleep. Can I at least admit that I don’t know if there is some greater power or not? And, if I listened and pondered… and if I ever saw or felt something I couldn’t explain, would I be open to admitting there might be? Because that’s all it takes, is a willingness to believe there might be something I cant explain. I was also told that I might not find my “God” out here. For every Mother Theresa I would find, there’s going to be a Hitler. For every piece of evidence there is some Power, I would find another that Power does not exist. But… if I looked inside and listened with an open mind and heart, down the long road of memory and into all of those thoughts and feelings… it was a fucking guarantee I’d find something I couldn’t quite explain with logic and rationale and that’s all that’s needed to begin.",1693064685.0

jxrb8hs,"I feel your pain. I'm about to turn 24 in a month and have actually went through something similar to you. I graduated from business school a year ago (with honors) but haven't gotten job (never applied to any except ONE). This past year I've also struggled with substance abuse. Basically chronic cannabis use and some Adderall binges every couple of months or so. I've been a total recluse in my parent's house and feel like a hopeless bum. Am still trying to rehabilitate myself and get myself out of my parents' house. In terms of school, maybe you can ask if you can complete the class on a pass/no pass basis, or make a case with the school that you are experiencing extreme personal hardship and want to complete your graduation a different term. I failed a class senior year college but made the case that I was going through extreme hardship. I was able to retroactively withdraw 7 months later from failing it with a letter from my therapist. In terms of telling your girlfriend and mom about substance abuse, I think it depends on how supportive your mom and girlfriend are. Is it the kind of relationship where you can be vulnerable, speak about the issues on your mind and find support. Or do you anticipate yourself not helped, misunderstood, maybe even further isolated from them. Can directly help you, can ""get"" your going through substantial issues without being offended, upset, overly emotional, etc? I know how it feels to be on the fence of whether or not to tell my parents about substance abuse. There is still a lot I've never told them. My parents are, in so many ways, dysfunctional simpletons and prefer to see the world (and people) from an oversimplified view. That is to say, when I tried bringing up substance abuse (as well as so many other problems) to my mom, she would not be helpful at all. In fact she would just make me feel worse. She is an extremely emotional person. I wish I realized this about her sooner. If you think your mom and girlfriend can listen to you and understand what's going on, if you can anticipate them actually making you feel better, then of course reach out to them. Can your girlfriend and mom be real and take your problems as seriously as you take them with openness and acceptance. Every person has their own struggles, we are supposed to rely on family and significant others to emotionally support us, to understand us and help us but sometimes this doesn't happen. Like with my family. I've never been through rehab, but if you feel like it'll really help you then why not. If you do not go to rehab and lack supportive people who can really help you, then you might be finding yourself in a tough situation that's just hard to get out of. That was my problem, was that I always thought I could make it through and manage my own problems. Whether if it's with alcohol, kratom, any other substance, these substances alter our mind so it's just harder for us to be focused, be happy, be on top of things, etc. It's significantly harder to control and not use a substance. We damage our dopamine receptors and are literally out of balance. When we're like this, pure willpower isn't something we can rely on. That is because the brain is out of balance, it needs time and a good environment to heal. Triggers and thoughts we have lead to use drinking, substance use even when we tell ourselves we are not going to do that. If you went to rehab, you might be able to finish school afterwards. I'm sure you'd feel much and would be able to pass your capstone classes, continue to graduate and move on with your life without your struggles. I was struggling with substance use when I was graduating. I wish I had intervention earlier rather than later. I'm currently in a drug treatment program because of a DUI and have learnt that most people think they can handle substance issues themselves when in reality this isn't the case. The brain needs time and the right environment to rewire and heal itself. I wish you the best of luck man.

jxim7pf,"Man, such a tough one. The reality is the best way you can help is to be a friend he can go to for sober activities while he tries to distance himself from his party friends. Ultimately you don’t have control over whether or not he uses, and you shouldn’t feel the burden of responsibility of trying to make sure he doesn’t use. That will likely only backfire (like the comment about not needing a lecture). People only really quit when they themselves have chosen to do so, and if he relapses (which is always a strong possibility with cocaine) that’s not on you. But yeah, I think the best thing you can do as a friend is help remind him all of the fun things there are to do that don’t involve cocaine. But make sure you do it in a way that isn’t explicitly like “isn’t this so much better than doing cocaine?” The fun sober things should become the norm, rather than treated like a distraction from the thing he really wants to do, which is doing cocaine. Hopefully that all made sense - good luck to both of you!",1692854249.0

It was an important lesson I needed to learn. I’m a great example of how addiction does not discriminate. I was a well educated, middle aged white woman who made the conscious decision to try heroin and then moved to crack. The shame surrounding my choices (because I should have “known better”) prevented me asking for help. I’m so glad my friend outed me to my family. That was the catalyst that led me to treatment.

From there I got my GED and went back to school. Now I have masters in Social work from USC. Never did I imagine this life I live now, ever.

I, for one, am leaving getting my tattoo until I'm at least 65 because I want to leave something exciting for old age. You could do something similar with the drugs you have yet to try. Why not make a deal with yourself? You tried weed and alcohol and went overboard. You've do e enough with the first 14 years of your life (probably 15 soon enough). You don't have to quit everything forever. Just give yourself another 15 years before you try anything new. See what life has to offer without drugs. If, in 15 years of waiting, you still feel like hard drugs are important and you still feel like you can not justify quitting weed and alcohol, go ahead and start drinking and using drugs again. Now the real question. Why is this something that you feel like you need to do? Do you have no goals relating to going to college? Don't you 2ant to be a veterinarian or vet tech, or maybe study marine biology? You can't do that stuff while battling addiction. Maybe you don't know how to make short and long term goals, or how to envision a future for yourself that is exciting and makes you happy. So, maybe all you have to think about is a choice of whether or not to give yourself a serious, crippling drug habit. I'm 46 years old and am in need of a kidney. My veins are so bad from shooting up drugs that the doctors can't find a vein for dialysis. You might think this is not going to happen to you. But, I started drinking and smoking weed at 15. Then i tried pills and by 17, I was addicted to snorting heroin. Once I became addicted to opiates I decided I might as well try shooting up. Being addicted to something completely changes your priorities. Hard drugs are super expensive and the people that have them are bad people. They will use your addiction to control you. They are the type or people to beat a person and rape them just because they can. Once people find out you are a drug addict, they will never listen to you. No one will trust you are believe you about anything. And anything you want to do or care about becomes secondary to getting the drug. Try to go 3 days without eating, just drinking water. Or however many days it takes for you to loose control and start shoveling food in your face uncontrollably. The feeling of being weak, yearning for food. The feeling of anger that comes up because you don't have any food. And that feeling like you'd do anything to just eat something... multiply that by a thousand. Physical pain combined with a desire so strong you can't think straight. That is what addiction to hard drugs is like. It is not like quitting weed or stop drinking. Plus, let's be honest. You only are quitting until you turn 21. Then at 21 it will be legal and, if you have been good, you will want to try smoking weed and alcohol again. You only have to say ""no"" to all drugs for now. When you are older you will make your own decisions. If you need help figuring out healthy goals, I'm happy to help. Also, this fall, why not go out for cross country team?

jxcqi5x,"As someone who has had a similar mindset, I have since recognized this is a destructive and useless thought pattern. Because once you try one “hard drug” you’ll probably find it doesn’t just satisfy that craving and that’s the end of it. You’ll start saying to yourself, “Well I’ve already done one hard drug, why not just do another?” And on and on. Try to remember the phrase “and then what?”. You take more drugs… and then what? Probably you take more. You decide to be sober… and then what? Hopefully you decide to be sober again. And then the next day you decide to be sober too. Likely your life improves and you feel more happy when you’re sober. It’s like this with a lot in life. You graduated highschool… and then what? You make a life for yourself. You get the job you’ve always wanted… and then what? You go to work everyday and do that job. It doesn’t complete your life, you just do that job now. You never finish, there is always “and then what?” We never get to decide the ending, only the beginning. Every day is a new beginning. Don’t let your next beginning be more harmful drugs. Something that helped me maintain sobriety was, maybe surprisingly, not deciding that this was the end of everything. I’m sober right now, and I plan on being tomorrow, but I’m not thinking about 10 years from now. You’ll be a different person in the future. Maybe in ten years you won’t even desire to take drugs. You don’t need to know that or decide that now, life will take you there. Time only moves forward, and it certainly doesn’t stop on its way there. I hope this isn’t too philosophical and abstract.

They help me reach a different state, and hits that same button that I used to hit with herb and other substance. I now crave those things. One of my favorites is cold exposure (I’ve baths/cold showers/river swims)… and if I really want to be feeling good, I have a great workout, then I will alternate hot sauna sessions with cold exposure. Hot-cold-hot-cold… no drug I have tried comes close to the extended good feeling I get from that. Especially because I know it’s good for me and making me stronger & healthier. That aspect adds so much more reward and value to the practice for my personally. (There is good science behind cold exposure. It’s creates the same dopamine dump as hard substance, but lasts significantly longer, in addition to all the health benefits. Many addicts are able to replace their doc with it in an increasing system of trade out. But that’s not really the point) When you put more distance between yourself and the substance (be it weed or even sugar) your body craves it less and less. It gets easier to stack days between even thinking about it. The more days you stack, the more you’re able to stack.

jx0a4wv,"This is your recovery journey and no one else’s. There is no one size fits all for people either. Unfortunately the old literature from the 1930’s when AA was created was made to say that addicts can never touch a mind altering substance again or else they will end up in jail, dead or whatever else it says. We have come a long way in research when it comes to addiction in the last few decades. I’m also a recovering addict from opioids and I have never had an issue in the past with any other substance. Since recovering I have been able to safely and socially drink alcohol when I feel like it. I also still continue to see my addictions physician regularly at the best mental health/addictions hospital that is in my country and she has never opposed this. Now, with that being said not all addicts are the same. There are some out there that cannot control any substance they use. If this is you then yes you definitely should never be touching any substance in your life again. But this is not all addicts experience. There actually is research to say that most addicts have an affinity for one particular substance - not all. And that fully recovering from a substance use disorder actually puts someone at a lower risk of developing another since they have the proper tools to manage and stop a new one from forming. Again, this is not all. Some people stop their DOC but never fully recover and still struggle on a daily basis with their recovery - these individuals in my opinion should not be touching anything. However, people that recover and have no triggers, cravings and are in a good place in their life (not depressed etc) should be able to safely use alcohol. I will be honest though and can understand where their concern comes from. You say in your post you did previously have an issue with consuming too much alcohol in the past and because of this it will make you more susceptible to having an issue in the future. If you’re the type of addict that cannot control any substance you consume then I would say you probably are playing with fire. I would suggest seeking professional help either by your PCP or an addictions specialist to get more insight on your situation as you do not want to have more issues in the future.",1692545372.0

jww63u4,"Well, I always suggest working with a professional to learn the tools that you can use to cope with the stressors or the triggers that normally cause you to turn to substances. As cliche as it sounds, therapy is an amazing tool! And this may sound counterintuitive but, as in my case, I grew up with severe adhd that was undiagnosed and untreated. I remember being a child and overhearing my doctor telling my mother I may need to be evaluated for hyperactivity but she wanted nothing to do with it. I acted out because I had impulsive behavior that I couldn’t control. Once I found sobriety and stated seeking treatment, I was told that I should consider a low dose of adhd medicine to help level out my symptoms but it will also control my impulsive tendencies that also included the drug cravings. I have been on 18mg of Concerta daily and I have managed to turn my life completely around. In your case, you could probably benefit from therapy or even just do some research to learn to redirect your attention when you’re in a situation that causes stress. Breathing exercises are great, journaling is also helpful. Also, look into getting into something you enjoy doing to relax yourself like art or drawing. In my studies, they have some research showing that Abilify and Risperdal has been helpful in those with autism. I always suggest medication as a last resort. If you’re wanting to stop marijuana because it’s affecting your life then I suggest the above. However, I am an advocate for medicinal use of marijuana in therapeutic doses. I personally choose not to use it but I have seen some very positive results from those that use it along with therapy and/or breathing exercises, redirection therapy, etc. if you suffer from anxiety, research the 333 Rule for Anxiety. Here’s a little summary: The 333 Rule asks that you find three examples of what you can see, hear, and touch within your current environment. While this method is short and simple, you should really take your time when focusing on each of the items you identify. This can help to take your mind off what’s causing your anxiety and stress and it can be helpful and calming.

Adult life can be incredibly engaging. Put recovery first, then engage those interests. They will change. Learn to build things, learn to create things, and engage that part of your brain. Challenge yourself and make yourself uncomfortable. The point isn’t to run away or quiet the turmoil in your head. That will always fail. It’s to learn to live with it and harness the energy into productive things. You’re capable of so much more then you’ve give yourself credit for. Engage that part of you and move forward.

jwomsxt,"Personally I wouldn't fuck with that. There are peoiple who have made it work as part of their recovery, and I believe them, but I think we need to be honest with our motivations: there's research which shows that a lot of different things do wonders for our mental health (exercise, therapy, meditation practices, healthy eating, and a long list of etc.). Have you exhausted every option and are turning to the last resort? Might there be another reason why as addicts people seem to be particularly drawn to the idea of psychedelics or ketamine as the solution to their problems? This isn't to invalidate any research or personal experiences, but I think any addict thinking about these options would need to do it after a very honest process of examining motives. Also remember that even from a scientific point of view, the idea that anything ""does wonders for your mental health"" isn't really accurate: research can show correlations between certain treatments and certain outcomes, but that doesn't mean that any one person is guaranteed to receive those effects. And there's always the possibility that the outcome could be completely different from what you expect. When I got clean there was a guy in the rooms with a week more than me, and we became very close in the first couple of months, and he always struggled with the idea that maybe mushrooms would help him. He ended up doing them, almost immediately ended up back on heroin, and hasn't managed to get clean again. That's not a unique story. There's a chance mushrooms could help me. But there's also a chance it could lead me to a full-blown relapse. If I end up in a full-blown relapse, there's a strong chance I could die, or not manage to get clean again.

jwarzr4,"I’m not a meth user but familiar enough with it to give a little advice. Meth makes people extremely paranoid (hence the cameras, phone hacking, etc) and manic. His pupils will be pretty dilated when under the influence. He’s most likely not sleeping when high or going to bed super late at night. The people in rehab I was around that were coming off meth would sleep a lot, like they could sleep 12-16 hours. As far as dealing with mood swings, I think they are generally best dealt with later. So for example if he comes home at night after work and has a mood swing, don’t really engage with him that night. But the next morning or day you can just tell him how it makes you feel and how it affects your relationship with him. When you think of dad you want to think of secure and consistent, not moody and unpredictable. You could say you know that it is not him acting this way but him being under the influence and that it would really improve his relationship, his life, and the lives of all those around him if he got help for his addiction. At the end of the day though, if he doesn’t want to go to formal treatment then you can’t really force him. You could maybe talk with your mom about having an intervention. The problem with high functioning addicts, as you mentioned, is that there are generally not a ton of consequences for their actions. Thus they aren’t forced into getting help. That is part of why you shouldn’t engage his mood swings, if you try to argue about the drug part of it he will deny it, shift blame, rationalize it, or use any other tactic to basically justify and rationalize what he’s doing. But if you tell him how it makes you feel and how it affects you he can’t really argue with that. So, when you are talking to him avoid using “you” as much as possible and try to use “I.” For ex: “Last night when we were at dinner I felt really uncomfortable, I feel like our relationship is becoming unpredictable, and I never know what version I am getting. I would like to have my relationship with my father back.” This tends to work a lot better than: “you came home last night and had another one of your mood swings, you must have been high, you need to get off the drugs, etc” Basically you can’t argue with someone when they say “I love you and care about you and I am having a hard time watching you struggle and I want to do anything I can to help so we can get back to having a good relationship.",1692114364.0

jw8g1ok,"I moved when I was 19 pretty much solely to move to an area with more sober people my age. It probably saved my life. I moved to Atlanta because I knew a bunch of sober teens and 20somehings from ICYPAA and similar conventions who lived there. Your best options are Nashville, NYC, LA, Atlanta and Minneapolis for good concentration of younger sober folks. I would avoid Florida. It has a history of scammy/low quality sober houses that fill the meetings with folks that are still using. I don't know about the Pacific NW. It seems to have a lot of folks that are clean from one thing, but still fucked up on other things. They don't live long. Yes, I know these are harsh generalizations, but in my experience these generalizations are kinda true. I'm sure there are lovely sober folks in many cities. I was looking for a concentration of sober people my age who wanted to stay sober. You seem to be looking for that too. I recommend checking out zoom meetings in your chosen area. Ask around before and after to identify the primary young people's meetings in the area. Contact the ICYPAA committee members from those towns and ask them where the younger people congregate. There is usually kind of a circuit that young people trend towards...going to X meeting at 8pm on Tues night and Y hoot owl meeting, for example You may have to do a little digging. Once you figure it out, go visit and check the vibe before you move. There are groups that have a lot of young people that don't tend to stay sober. Look for good sobriety first.

jvzoijw,"Connecting to other people that understand us is a wonderful thing. It is what helped me most with my issues too. Keep reaching out, you are not alone with this hard stuff. And congrats on your progress. 🤍 I’ve had a hard time at your age too. It took me a few years to be able to call a therapist for an appointment. I think I was 15 when I finally managed to make that step. Well it turned out that if you are under 18 you need your parents permission because of insurance I think. I was scared to tell my parents about it (because not being able to open up to my parents was one of my main issues I guess) but I did it anyway and everything worked out fine. Another thing you can do is go to your school counselor. I think every school in Germany has that (I’m from Bavaria as well btw). I found it a bit hard to open up to someone I could see everyday at school. But looking back I shouldn’t have. I see now that all of this was caused by my fear of attachment and that I tried to keep some emotional distance to people to keep me safe. If I had been more open and honest about my struggles they would have been more able to help me. So my takeaway is, tell them everything, don’t be scared, the more you open up the more they can help you with this. It’s okay. People care about you and you deserve to feel better. 💜",1691926661.0

jvvixrv,"So the re-entry to life, after addiction and after a time in recovery - can plateau. Like getting sober is a slow steady pace but real life doesn’t work that way. Often there are plateaus and large spikes in both directions, real life can change on a dime. It is hard to get used to. While in active addiction, I am at a steady flat rate that only changes depending on my level of drunkenness, but ultimately it is something I control. There is a definite issue in addiction with control. - in many ways. You can’t control real life. So take the positives as they come and appreciate them for what they; accept that change sometimes requires a leap of faith. A reasoned, well calculated risk - like getting a job and paying your own bills after addiction - is a leap we all need to take in recovery. I have had it work out both ways for me but looking back I waited too long to really go for it. The sense of satisfaction of being self-sufficient is a wonderful thing. It motivates me that I can support myself and my family, it is a definite positive. If the worst is to happen, it sounds like you have a good safety net. If something happens you just try again. You just have to find your own way to break through and take that leap. It sounds very much like your ready, your post is insightful. Well I will stop rambling. Good luck OP! Edit- Have you tried any kinda traditional therapy? It has really helped me after finding the right person to talk to. With Telehealth, I can have the meetings in my room, it is much easier to open up, also it doesn’t matter where you live as long as you have WiFi.

I was 31 when I finally had enough, I’ll be 40 in November. 1/3/15 As long as I make it my 10th anniversary I will have been sober as long as I spent drinking, I’m really looking forward to that milestone. I’ve never used nicotine so it’s a bit tough to relate on that aspect but if you treat it similarly to the way in which you quit drinking you can make it work. Being adhd myself I know that having something to do with my hands helps with the restlessness. So pick up a fidget toy or hobby. (Might I suggest learning to crochet or knit. (Men can do it too) Walking is another good way to relieve anxiety and pent up energy. As for myself I used 12 step meetings and surrounded myself with people who were in recovery and active in bettering themselves. I found a sponsor and did whatever was asked of me. Prayed in the morning and txted them after even a good morning just to check in. The accountability and willingness to try anything is what makes success. Today I live my life pretty normally but I did meetings I think the first 3ish years. I too felt like I was a bit late to the game but honestly my 30s was a good time to get and stay sober, I had my 20s behind me so there wasn’t as much wistfulness of what I was “missing” and plenty of time to move my life forward in a productive way. Remember that some people don’t get the gift of recovery ever and die before ever trying. Or they come in in their 40s,50s,60s and later. Seek out new hobbies and activities and do things you may have always wanted to but couldn’t because you were too busy with alcohol. Try it all out!

jvpe43x,"Working out/ exercising is definitely underrepresented in the comments imo!! (currently recovered/recovering from all of what you mentioned, and then some ;) It’s true, of course, that “hobbies” are the answer… but if you’re anything like me, just picking up a new hobby or project can be pretty hard, like (What do I do? What am I even interested in? What will I be good out? How will I learn? Who will practice with me/teach me/etc? How do I acquire the equipment I need for it? Etc etc…) So, I’ve found exercising daily can be more approachable and also have additional benefits - not just for your physical health but mentally speaking, too. Granted I’ve been into fitness and working out for a long time because of my line of work, so I’m sure it was easier for me to start as a habit to fully delve into in recovery than for someone who has never had an exercise program - but it’s well worth it for everyone. I’m sure you’ve heard some of the studies gaining popularity about how it helps mitigate depression and anxiety… it helps your brain make dopamine, not to mention just being healthy and good for you and all that stuff ;) For me, I just told myself I’d do something at a certain time of day (earlier is better, it helps set my mind right for the day and gives me a sort of calm energy) and that anything is better than nothing - even if I didn’t have the motivation, inspiration, or energy to come up with much less perform an elaborate workout, I could always pull 5 sets of pushups out of my ass, you know. That helped me gain my sanity so much in those first few months, and eventually became a daily habit I just do every day without having to think about it really, like taking a shower. It doesn’t require a “hobby” or “enthusiast” level of knowledge, skill, or experience to do, so it’s easier for me when I’m in a highly dysfunctional or unmotivated state - you might need to learn some basic chords before you pick up the guitar, for example, but anyone at any time can go for going for a walk or jog around the block or do some pushups. However, you easily CAN become very interested in learning about it and get into it at the enthusiast or amateur level and it can become a hobby, an interest, or even a passion.

jvfmad5,"I hear you, my drug of choice was also psychedelics and marijuana. Regardless of whether other people could use them, I couldn’t help but overuse them as self medication and to bridge the gap between me and the spiritual world. It’s now something I chase with meditation, lucid dreaming, and astral projection. Much less self destructive ways to expand my mind, and scratches the same itch as those drugs. My urge to use really went down when I learned that I can access those spiritual heights while sober. Psychedelics were quite the shortcut though, and I also had a full blown relationship with them and mourned them when I got clean. And yes it is awkward when people praise my drugs of choice. I think that non-addicts can function with them in a way that I can’t. And maybe since it’s like a relationship, other people can for a healthy attachment to it while I can’t. But I am honestly very skeptical of people in recovery who use them.

jvdwsrv,"I have this to offer you. Many of us were and are miserable sober, especially in the beginning. I would argue a vast majority of people who are addicts are mentally ill. But being sober is the only chance you have of getting that shot at contentment(I avoid the word happy because happy is fleeting. Contentment is sustainable a majority of the time). You're never gonna have good relationships, income and home stability while using. Maslow's hierarchy of needs comes into play here. You can research that if not familiar. NA is a good place to start. It's by donation only. It provides you with 24/7 access to a community of people who have been exactly in your shoes. Zoom meetings are constant. But I would connect with your local NA community too. That support is crucial in the beginning. Most everyone there has been where you are. But the meetings are also hotbeds of information for other things. I'm sure you'll be able to connect with people who can assist you with where you can access low cost health care, psych professionals, psych meds and sliding scale counseling services. And if you're in the US, calling 211 might help give you resources too. Whatever your substance of choice, they all fuck with our brain chemistry. It's important to note that this takes time to heal too and rebound depression, which is part of PAWS, is a real thing. Some people do experience that pink cloud initially and some don't.

jvcw6et,"op, i have read your history and all your replies. i just want to say one thing, you said marcy didn't blame you. you were probably 20 something, or even younger when you guys met. you were an addict probably. addicts are not known for making the best choices, no? you made mistakes, and very big ones, but that's a human thing. some people make bigger mistakes than others. it is not my place to forgive you or blame you (although when i first read your post i reacted the same way a lot of people did) but let me tell you one thing. marcy knew what's up. she knew what you did and she stayed. she wanted to try drugs. i mean, i'm not gonna ignore your influence on her as her boyfriend but she chose to use it. i'm not putting all blame on her, but putting all the blame on you doesn't seem to right either. (if you weren't much older than her) she knew the risks, she knew everything and still chose to stay with you. she chose to use drugs. it is easy to put all the blame on you as if it weren't for you she couldn't get heroin, but if a person is willing to try heroin or even willing to date a dealer that means they know the deal. we are not on the euphoria set, no dealer is like fez. real life doesn't work like that. dating a dealer and expecting everything to turn out to be fine? that's some movie shit bro. i feel deeply sorry for marcy, but you told us she was curious about drugs. so if it weren't for you, she would've found someone else to get drugs. (probably) you could say no to her, but we don't know the outcome of it. like she could still try it after breaking up with you. you don't know. and you will never know that. i can understand her parents and loved ones blaming you, because like i said it is easier this way. and you certainly have a role in it. but you still deserve redemption. marcy didn't blame you. she hoped that you'd still be clean. you didn't say no to her that day and gave her drugs but by staying clean, and helping yourself and going to therapy you can say no. you see, you can't turn back and change the past. but you can change the future by saying no this time. you are in your head, and what you are going through is really hard. i hope you are in a good place now. say no. you owe that to marcy. you owe that to yourself. please, please say no.",1691530642.0

jvabv74,"Inventory has absolutely nothing to do with blame. It is a process in which the past is examined and a person takes stock of their role in it, specifically their role and only their role in different areas of their lives. It is done through a lens of fact and accountability, reviewing resentments and feelings without cognitive distortion or bias or taking the inventory of someone else. We look at our side of the street and we look hard. Depending on the method, different areas are separated into sections of the inventory where resentments, feelings, those affected, outcomes, consequences, defects, principles are all cataloged as if a person is in a warehouse taking stock of what’s there. It’s a procedural process, not a trial or a debate within one’s self over who did what to who and who was more justified or I did this because you did that or they had it coming or I’m right to be resentful or these are the rationalizations I have for feeling this way or doing XYZ. Those integers are immaterial in a 4th step. This is black and white data as the process is laid out. Resentments are a key component of it as they keep us sick and suffering regardless of what crisis brought us to the steps. Inventory offers the beginning of a path to freedom from resentment - It is not about forgiveness or condoning the past, it’s about seeing it for what it was and finding acceptance of it so we can move on with freedom achieved via spiritual action. As long as we resent the past, we are unable to accept it and as long as we refuse to accept the past as it was, we will resent it and the people within it. That’s a recovery death sentence and often enough a literal one. The information gleaned from the inventory is then shared in 5 with a sponsor or another human being of ones choosing. The sponsor or person hearing the 5th step may offer their own experience or perspective in separating a person’s role in things from other dynamics such as over responsibility, a lack of accountability, putting undo harms or guilt on one’s self when others were active participants, viewing one’s self as a perpetual victim in situations in which problems were of the persons own making, what defects were at play and what their spiritual opposites were. It varies. The most important thing is that it’s brought out of the warehouse, presented to a someone else and with whatever a persons concept of God is and shared so that it can be seen in the light of day for what it is and isn’t. Typically we’re not as bad or as good as we imagined - We’re just human and the inventory helps dispel perception versus reality conflicts. After 5, the inventory serves as the reference material for 6, 7, 8 and 9. Defects and liabilities were revealed in inventory, those get catalogued and parsed and we go through them to see how we act on them, when we act on them, sometimes why, what the results are. The goal is essentially to show that we have a bunch of defects, it’s part of the human condition, the spiritual opposites are always going to be better than things like anger and resentment and fear and rejection and self-centeredness and whatever else, we are welcome to hold on to them if we really want to but all it does is bring us suffering. Our anger and resentments for instance, if not replaced with love and acceptance, will continue to hurt us. You can be angry if you want, go ahead. It’s not somebody else you’re hurting by doing it. Accept it and move forward in the spiritual principle contrary to it or continue being miserable, it’s up to you. It also highlights that awareness of defects and fighting them or suppressing them or learning about them is not enough to have them removed or lessened - That would mean that we have power over human nature at its core, power that goes beyond what humans actually have. Maybe awareness yields some benefit and we’re responsible for our behaviors regardless but instead of fighting defects, we trust fall into our higher power / God to help us do what we can’t the same as we did in earlier steps. 6-7 are surrender on steroids. Harms and amends are also farmed from the inventory and have nothing to do with blame. A common practice is for a sponsor to take someone’s resentment list from 4, hand it back to them and say, “This is the start of your harms and amends list. Have at it.” This is not to say we owe an amends to or caused harm in every single situation in which we resent someone. No sponsor who isn’t a psychopath is going to tell you to go apologize or make something up to someone who abused you in a situation where you had absolutely no role whatsoever aside from being a victim. Those situations might be rarer than a person would think but that’s not what the step is for or the spirit of it. We are again looking at our side of the street, our roles, how we impacted situations, how we caused harm, how we played a part in our resentments and whatnot and figuring out what we need to do as far as offering restitution, restoration, reparations for harms caused. Sometimes our role in our resentments and harms that resulted requires some consideration beyond what’s immediately evident. The previous steps prepared us for that. It’s not Catholic confession or penance, it’s just janitorial work and when it’s clean, we clock out and go home, the results of each amends or if someone wants to hear it or what they say or do doesn’t matter. We became willing. Not every resentment is paired to an amends but if we were not responsible for living in the solution of things that happened to us after they occurred and the subsequent outcomes of us not addressing them with action was defective or destructive behavior, that’s not on them - That’s on us. We’re not always responsible for the things that happened to us but we are responsible for the solutions and our reactions, behaviors we attribute to being cause and effect from slights or harms or trauma or whatever else. If we continue to suffer the past and use those events as license to act out in defect or self-destruction, we need to address that, nobody else is going to do it for us and amends are done for us - Not for them. We clean up our side of things so we can move on with our lives. We can’t heal other people and we’re not responsible for doing that. Others can’t heal us and they’re not responsible for our healing either, that’s on us. Amends are made directly when able and when no harm will be caused to others as a result of the direct amends. Harm is a wide concept. “Others” includes us. We don’t go into an amends where it’s going to harm someone by retraumatizing them, taking them on a itemized trip down every awful thing we ever did that could cause them more harm, involving other people in ways that could harm them or where we would be unburdening ourselves at someone else’s expense. We don’t do amends that will cause us harm either - We take accountability and ownership of our behaviors but we’re mindful in this process that we don’t put ourselves in harms way. A sponsor and a higher power can help determine how best to approach amends as some are more complicated than others. Some amends become indirect or living amends if direct amends can’t be made, we find another way to address it with spiritual action in the opposite of our old ways. The steps are the solution in the A’s. The rest is just trim. It can be tough sledding but it’s worth it.",1691494476.0

I told myself that my job paid so well and a few of my coworkers are self-proclaimed addicts but still functional so I could do it. If they could do it, I could definitely do it. I was different.

You can if you like, but I was trying to help OP. AA and its members are not qualified to determine anything about the members, especially whether or not they are emotionally regulated or healthy. AA markets itself as a 'spiritual' program, not 'religious' or 'psychological', which was my point. Maybe I could have expressed that better. While you are correct that only OP can decide if they are emotionally well, avoiding one's emotions is something that anyone should talk to a trained professional about.

jv6gu6b,"""Emotional Sobriety"" is a nonsensical term that AA came up with, just like ""Dry Drunk"", and they are related. The idea that your emotions and thoughts can be considered 'alcoholic behavior' in the absence of alcohol is the very essence of thought policing. In the absence of alcohol, we're just being selfish assholes, not 'alcoholics'. But I digress... &#x200B; What they should have said instead of emotional sobriety is that the person isn't able to regulate their emotions. So instead of 'Am I not emotionally sober?"", maybe ask, ""I'm I able to process and regulate my emotions in a healthy way?"" &#x200B; The answer you've given is 'no', and that's ok. Finding out that we have an issue we need to work on is the first step in addressing any problem. GreyPaws is spot on in suggesting seeing a counselor, one who has experience with substance use disorder. This way, they'll better understand the things you tell them. I highly suggest getting one of these therapists. If you're in AA, your sponsor is not qualified to do this work with you. Many, if not most, people became Alcoholics/Addicts while self-medicating an undiagnosed, untreated, or undertreated underlying mental or behavioral health issue. For those rare folks who might not be in this class, they'll have likely picked up a M/BH issue in their journey. Trauma is a major cause of addiction, as is clinical depression, anxiety, and the like. Meds may or may not be called for in your case. If you do end up on meds, please understand that meds are only part of the process. Without therapy, you won't learn how to feel safe enough to feel and express your emotions in a healthy way. This is a prerequisite to having loving and caring adult relationships. The work will be challenging for you, but you can do it. With a therapist, you can face whatever you need to, walk through it and come out the other side. Think of Recovery like SAMHSA does - Recovery is: “A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential” This is what everyone wants, don't they? I know I do. By the way, SAMHSA _HYPERLINK_ stands for the: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. There is no shame in the Addiction or Mental Health Help game!",1691426435.0

I’m now 5 months into my recovery and 90 percent of those symptoms have passed. I’m feeling pretty much back to normal. I know I still have a long way to go. Although I feel like the worst is gone. My biggest symptom at this point is just some short term memory loss. But I also find that getting better as the days pass. Good luck on your recovery! If you find the depression is unbearable I would recommend speaking to a physician to see what they can do to help (possibly medications depending on the severity). I personally did not want to take any as I have had awful experiences in the past with withdrawal from antidepressants. One thing that really helped me naturally was I completely changed my diet (cut out all processed foods and sugar) and I also started working out every day - and still do.

juxus5s,"The most important thing I learned when a loved one was going through recovery was that alcoholism is a progressive disease. It will get worse. Damage increases both in the brain and in the body, and eventually the body breaks down, thinking & memory suck, and emotional connections wither into damaged relationships. It's pretty much guaranteed: ""Functioning"" alcoholics who seem normal and able to manage daily life's realities will become increasingly less able to function and sicker both physically and neurologically if they continue to drink. You sound very self-aware and capable of introspection, so you're probably a great candidate for learning more about the science of addiction and how it has physically affected your brain, and very capable of learning more about yourself, what makes you tic (why do you drink, for ex.), how your early life may have affected your emotional self. Detox is really tough. A good rehab will help you through it safely, though. While in the recovery program after detox, you can learn healthier ways to approach problems/hard feelings in daily life, ways to change your thinking about yourself to increase your self-esteem, hope, and peace. You can learn to manage your emotions with coping strategies, communication skills, firm boundaries, etc. instead of drinking to escape. As for finding ways to have fun without drinking, be patient. Your fun-meter will rise again! Your experience of boredom and failure to find FUN when you got clean previously has everything to do with your brain, which has been neurologically rewired to seek the dopamine rush of intoxication. Nothing else feels fun when your brain is still addicted! Brace yourself, because it takes a couple of years for a sober person's brain to heal from the damage from alcohol. It does improve constantly, noticeably, over time. During those 2 years, therapy and/or a conscientious AA or other program is a huge boost to being successful maintaining sobriety and rebuilding yourself. Best wishes for your recovery!

jupjzyo,"Well just speaking in the social work degree, are you sure that's a low pay field? I'm pretty sure you can make a significantly high salary(nearly six figure in my area) with an MSW, so if you already have a degree, I'm assuming bachelor's, then maybe going back to school and getting your MSW would help you to find your calling.

jup3t2i,"3.5 years ago I was right where you are now. I came to Reddit first because I was desperate and afraid. I couldn't tell anyone in my life how difficult things had become. Some very kind internet strangers offered both encouragement and even more importantly hope. Going to treatment was the best thing I've done in my entire life. As _USERNAME_ said, seize the opportunity. Treatment is what you make of it. Do the work, take suggestions and take the opportunity to be yourself for the first time in awhile. I needed the complete separation from what my life had become in order to reset. I like to tell people that I had 1,000 problems before I went into rehab. When I left I had 999 problems. Seems insignificant to most people. That one problem though? That one kept me from being able to do anything about the other 999. With the ""monkey off my back"" the other 999 became surprisingly and completely manageable. My advice, ignore just about every other problem you can besides establishing the best possible means of recovery for yourself. With that, you can do anything. Without it, all of the other issues become overwhelming. Take the time you have in treatment to find yourself again and what a life in recovery will be for you. The possibilities are endless. ""Reddit Recovery"" set me on the right track. It still helps to this day. 3.5 years later and I'm still in touch with one or two of those random internet strangers which is both crazy and wonderful. I will say that there's a bunch more I've done to stay sober and live a better life. Figure out what that will look like for you and pursue it. Never hesitate to message me anytime",1691108840.0

jumqsj1,"He totally thinks he’s getting away with it. I’ve heard it so many times that “I was only hurting myself, my family didn’t even know.” Until they find out that pretty much everyone knew (me included). The only thing I wish anyone had done differently for me… was perhaps to stop trying to save me with love and compassion, and instead have allowed me to feel the full force of the consequences of my actions before their hearts were broken. I personally wasn’t able to get sober until I had burned every bridge and alienated every person. Despite solemn, heartfelt promises and various methods of my trying to get sober like: Giving people all my money to hold, swearing off the “hard” stuff, only getting wasted on weekends, getting overnight jobs, proposing marriage, wanting kids (which thankfully never happened), seeing a therapist, going to meetings (though only after runs), detoxes, rehabs, and a thousand other things… Until there was no one left to turn to, no one to talk to, no love remaining in anyone’s eyes (only fear and disgust), no shoulder to cry on, no one to give/loan me money (or to steal from), no one to feed me, no one to check up on me, and no one to come rescue me from whatever mess I was in. Until it was just me, the substances and the giant, smoking crater that was my life… That crater a jagged, shit-filled pit. Stacked with the rotting corpses of my hopes and dreams and haunted by the consequences of my actions. And me in the middle, surrounded by it all. Stuck solidly in all the shit I, myself, had shoveled into it, which had become so deep and foul, that dousing myself in a wide variety of chemicals no longer took away the smell or helped dull the recognition of being neck deep in feces. That’s what it took for me. Not everyone has to go so low, but I personally would not, could not stop, as long as there was a single way left for me to keep going… as long as there was a single person left I could use and manipulate into giving me the one thing I craved that the substances couldn’t provide: Love. So, try support and love, but be firm in your boundaries and what you, yourself are willing to put up with. Find your own support group (for family/friends of addicts) and see what worked for them… there are many out there. And remember most of all this: “I can’t save You from you, but I can save Me from you.”",1691076767.0
jumox7f,"I started my recovery journey two years ago. At that time I was 33, had gotten a degree in business admin and worked for a financial accounting firm for 5 years, all while using some combination of opiates or uppers or both. I quit to try to figure my shit out. Hasn't been easy, I have relapsed a few times but I used to automate tasks at my old job as a side value add. Was told I could do software engineering without a cs degree so I hunkered down with a remote coding program and got a job working in big tech in the silicon valley. It's hard and stressful but I'm proud of myself for proving to me that 9 years of opiate and speed use did not mean I could not excel in an industry that I was passionate about. You can do anything you want to, your past as an addict doesn't need to prevent you from being who you want to be. Obviously having a record can be a harder journey and I didn't have one but my managers all still know I am a recovering addict. I chose to share it in the application process and I believe that because of the way I framed it that it helped me get the job.

julxski,"I didn’t have a partner in active addiction, I didn’t wanna deal with someone telling me I was wrong for doing what I was doing. I wanted to do what I wanted and be free, and was conscious enough to know that I didn’t need to be someone. I also didn’t date anyone with an active addiction, mostly cause I knew it was wrong, and so if you’re doing drugs and I’m doing drugs, do we really love n care for each other? No not really. But sometimes addicts can’t be honest w themselves about how their choices can affect others. Specially if they wanna have their cake and eat it too, once we normalize drug use and become high functioning addicts, it feels like, yeah why not I can have the family and also do what I do on the low. No big deal. Honestly like the first two years of recovery they advise that recovering addicts not be in relationships, cause we’re easily swayed into stepping back into addiction by any minor inconvenience. We lack proper coping mechanisms and boundaries. You’re upset because you don’t want to set the right boundaries, fearing it might make him leave. But him leaving and going on a few benders and being alone every night might be what saves him. Do you wanna be with an addict for the rest of your life? If you’re willing to accept his addiction then okay, go for it. But if you want more for your life, setting boundaries are to keep you safe and okay. You can’t save him, he can only do that for himself. I know fathers and husbands with kids and wives and mortgages who continue to do what they do, their wives know but they’ve dealt w it so long and adjusted their life to it that they’ve accepted that’s all there ever will be for them. Do you want that for yourself? You have to stop centering all the love worry and care around him, and give it to yourself. It sounds like you’re hurting and you will continue to unless you learn to be honest and up front. Like I said earlier going along with the bit, helps no one but his addiction. And as long as he keeps choosing his friends over you, his addiction over his future, then he can’t have one with you. It’s just a fantasy that’s being sold to you and you’re buying. When I got with my now husband, he was up front with me and he told me, I don’t want my boys to be around a drug addict. I want to marry you and have a family with you one day, but I can’t if you don’t get clean. I had a choice to make, we all do. Stop supporting the bit. Set your boundaries and stick to your word, follow through with what you say you’ll do. Call his addiction out, don’t foster the secrecy that it loves to have.

Someone got me to do it by saying it was just really ""good"" out of town coke. It's a shitty thing to do n I'm sorry this happened to you. It'll wear off...it doesn't seem like it will but it will... Just try to drink plenty of water. You can take a shot of apple cider vinegar or anything with vitamin C to help break it down.

juhuyyu,"As others have said, PAWS from benzo withdrawal, even after a month like your friend, can be really dangerous, and your friend needs to be seen by a doctor. 💕 If they already are under a physician’s care, I’m sorry for assuming, and thanks for helping your friend. I know you asked about foods, but I have to mention Zofran, a miracle nausea medicine dissolves under the tongue, and acts very fast. It’s a pretty harmless medicine, and not a controlled substance, so doctors don’t mind prescribing it for nausea/vomiting. If they’re not keeping much of anything down, a Zofran can make a huge difference. They’ll mercifully stop vomiting for a while, actually keep some calories/electrolytes down, and hopefully catch a small nap or at least rest. If you’re talking to a doc and being open about the WD, they might also give some Clonidine - a blood pressure medicine used sometimes for withdrawals, anxiety, and insomnia. It makes ya a bit sleepy, just calms you down. Also, not a controlled substance, but helpful for the bad anxiety. Immodium is very helpful to have around, too! Your poor stomach is just wrecked, for awhile. Thanks for caring for them; it’s one of the worst withdrawals, and it can take many months to get back to some semblance of normalcy. I’m sure they’re grateful to have you there. It’s miserable and scary, but they’ll get through it. For food/drinks: nutritious broth; plain white rice; boring old toast, maybe a hint of butter; applesauce; bananas; lots of electrolyte drinks, and calorie-rich drinks like Ensure help a lot when you’re soooo nauseous - the easiest and tastiest method you can use to cram some calories in, the better. Temperate (not too hot) baths help. Having a nice cool rag handy, or a cool, cloth ice pack, as well as a sweater/bathrobe, and nice clean blankets and sheets are wonderfully comforting. You’re often feeling freezing, shivering; then burning up, and always sweating buckets. Never a consistent temperature, and it’s an awful feeling. A comforting show or good movie to binge watch is a good thing once the severe vomiting is better - keep their mind focused on something kinda pleasant, but not hard to follow. I watched ‘Adventure Time’ when I was very sick, and it was a good choice. They’ve made it a long time not using!! While they’re not out of the woods yet, and have a bit of a road ahead, that’s a whole month of clean time, which is no small feat!

jugkpxt,Rehabs that don’t allow calls border on abuse to me. I myself feel for your dad. Im a recovering alcoholic. I am in AA and have considered that my foundation for recovery. AA saved my life and gives me life. I go to meetings online daily and once in person. My husband and I met in the rooms. We have a very healthy and Loving marriage because of the 12 steps. So remember there is help! If I know what rehab it is recovery centers of America a lot of the commenters are right. Any rehab that allows no calls is nowhere I want to be. Detoxing off booze 🥃 is brutal and anxiety is part of it. The only thing that would get me through was talking to my family. My mom and dad helped me through it the second time around. First time I did it cold turkey 🦃 and second time detoxed at a facility. When I was told they took my phone and I couldn’t have contact with my mom and dad and AA friends for first week I signed myself out that was 11/24/19. I have not had a drink since 11/22/19. Im sober because of those close friends. Many facilities allow cell phones now for a few hours. My good friend was just in patient for quite some time. We had regular daily contact through Facebook messenger text video calls. She chose that facility because she needed her network. You sound like an amazing son! Your dad sounds like a fighter.

If you signed all the documents you should be able to talk to the facility tho. It may take some more persistence but it’s not totally out of the ordinary. Once your in a medical protocol and on drugs to detox there ain’t much going back. And in my experience, everyone wants out immediately. I’ve seen people sign themselves out for ridiculous reasons. It’s rehab. It ain’t the ritz. I went to RCA in south jersey and I knew where I was and I didn’t confuse it for anything luxurious. Part of the appeal is that you don’t want to come back. If you fight it the entire time, it will suck. At a certain point, maybe around day 5-6, you start to shake less and steady yourself and eat more and maybe stop feeling so damn sorry for yourself that you might just let people help. Many people do not allow that to happen. Too stubborn or too stupid or both or angry or who knows? Someone gave me some good advice early on to stick with the winners. It’s like that with anything. There will be a bunch of old timers who know better, a bunch of assholes that juts try to shit in everything and a few people who are willing to go to any lengths to change. That was me. No visitors, no internet, no drama, no turning back. They would’ve called you if your dad was in trouble. The blackout serves two ways. Alcoholism is rarely just a one person problem. Everyone involved needs help. I suggest alanon for yourself and taking the time to really take care of yourself. RCA was no joke and it saved my life. He’s safe. Keep him in there.",1690942966.0
juf80u2,"one thing to keep in mind is that medical professionals aren't able to speak with anyone about a patient/their condition without said patient signing a release to authorize them to do so. that may account for the lack of communication on the therapist's end. in my experience, 3-7 day communication blackouts were normal. it usually encompassed detox or the bulk of acute withdrawal. i can't personally speak to the severity of alcohol withdrawal but it can be really rough. speaking generally about communication - i've been in treatment centers that allowed - after the initial blackout period - daily phone calls, phone calls once a week, and phone calls every other day. it all seems to depend on the facility. i found that writing letters (and receiving them) helped me a lot. another thing to consider: most, if not all, rehabs are at-will facilities. people can leave whenever they want (unless they're there under court order, i suppose). so if it's really not a good place and if your dad is medically stable it might be worth looking into going somewhere else if there's a better option available. either way, i'm sorry that this has been such a stressful and difficult situation for you. i hope your dad gets the help he needs and that you're able to get some peace of mind along the way.",1690938310.0

ju9rcoo,"There’s probably reasons that the only recovery programs on earth that don’t view abstinence as clean / sober are Moderation Management and the psychedelics twelve step fellowship. There’s likely reasons you can’t find meetings for them anywhere as well. When LifeRing and Stoic Recovery have more of a following than a particular group, it’s probably worth questioning efficacy. You won’t track down much in the way of legitimate accredited professional resources that don’t view abstinence as recovery either. I’d imagine if you can get clean from everything else and use one drug successfully while you can’t use any others successfully you would have, you will, and if you can’t, you won’t. I don’t believe that’s a learned thing but who knows, maybe there’s a shaman somewhere. The availability of resources to support people in doing what you’re looking to do would probably reflect how realistic it is and and validity of it being a serious recovery approach. With every drug addict in the history of the world trying to hold on to at least one drug rather than actually getting clean, if there was a sustainable way of doing it that worked for anyone outside of a very, very, very small percentage of people, they would have found it by now and it would be the hottest ticket in town. Maybe you’re special, who knows. Proof would be in the pudding, if you can do it your way against the best practices of every informed resource out there, go for it. You could also look at it this way - Say weed isn’t a problem. Okay. Alcohol and other drugs, they’re going to kill you. You can’t stop doing them. The resources you need to stop and not die, the price of admission is that you stop smoking weed. A sane person who didn’t have a problem with weed would look at the situation, do a simple cost benefit analysis, note that abstinence based recovery like rehab and meetings had been effective in the past, smoking weed wasn’t worth dying from using these other substances and they’d stop so they could avail of these resources. Instead, you’re opting to not because it doesn’t fit with your desire to continue to smoke weed. If weed is the barrier between you and legitimate efficacious recovery resources, I’d imagine that makes it a problem, not the lack of resources to help you continue to smoke weed while pursuing recovery.

ju8yxqa,"It’s every area and every meeting as it’s laid out black and white by NA literature. _HYPERLINK_ “Many of us have heard, either individually or in meetings, that members taking medication are not clean. However, some mental health medications are prescribed to help manage symptoms that interfere with leading a healthy, productive, drug-free lifestyle. Members who take mental health medication as prescribed by a healthcare professional are considered clean.” Group autonomy decisions to try and not recognize being on mental health medication as clean would be a violation of Tradition 4 - “Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or NA as a whole” and Tradition 10 - “Narcotics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the NA name ought never be drawn into public controversy.” Mental healthcare and medication for mental health is an outside issue. Random addict opinions in general are also an outside issue, including their opinions on mental healthcare. If an addict or group of addicts tells someone they aren’t clean in the program of Narcotics Anonymous because they’re taking mental health medication as prescribed, they are not speaking for Narcotics Anonymous and are presenting a program and opinions that is and are not associated with Narcotics Anonymous. While we can’t make them learn how to read, how to observe and follow traditions and literature or shut the fuck up, we certainly can provide accurate information to others and ignore them.",1690834120.0
ju8rpvn,"Yea. You need a lawyer. This is really shitty because when you’re in a drug relationship its mutually abusive. The problem is men are typically more selfish, conniving, and lying all the time. So maybe you did hit him, and maybe he did get a skull fracture but he probably started it. But. First of all keep your mouth closed talking to the po po. Find a lawyer, get everyone you know from meetings to write you letters. Unfortunately a skull fracture is a serious injury and you need to talk with your lawyer about what that means as far as time and if youre gonna see jail or prison in the worst case scenario. But! One good thing I learned in an abusive drug relationship is it is hard as fuck to prove some one did shit to you. Maybe he had that skull fracture from a fight with a man and pinned it on you. Is he dishonest?? Great disparage his character in court What you need to do rn Is chose life. Do whatever you can to pick you first. Play that tape doing drugs rn will absolutely result in you going to prison. You can stay clean need a little extra help, get maintenance meds from a psychiatrist or a suboxone doctor. Jail and or prison for women is not that bad. Esp if you end up in that situation for domestic abuse… People are gonna be nice to you. It might even be a good thing! But thats not gonna happen to you because youre gonna stay clean rn. Youre gonna be 100 percent honest with your lawyer. If they seem shitty, find a way to pay for one. But be reasonable… like it could be bad. You need to educate yourself on the strategies theyre gonna use, and one might even be do a little time and a drug program. That is an awesome outcome and scenario!!! But I dont think thats gonna happen Because I think hes a serial liar and abuser and you can def find other bitches he’s abused or men hes fought. And who knows maybe he got that fracture because he shot up and fell down Theyre gonna need you in the room with a candlestick like a woman isnt gonna cause a skull fracture with her hands! Dont despair is all Im saying. Even the worst case scenario isnt that bad. Right now youre experiencing trauma but youre mostly experiencing getting sober… Thats a lot on your body and your thoughts will lie to you.

You seem to be in a lot of trouble and a possible solution is to surrender to the assistance of those who have changed their lives and/or have integrity. NA's Basic Text talks about unmanageability and the need to give up control to others who learned how to live life on life's terms. That doesn't mean we become thoughtless cult members; it means that the combined experience of people who got better can be harnessed for own good (page 98). I myself am not good at surrendering to the NA Fellowship and/or Program; but the process of having a sponsor and working the steps seems to help really busted up junkies turn their lives around and maintain recovery. ...and if you don't like NA, the idea still stands: you seem to be in trouble and can't get out of it yourself; therefore 'surrender' to someone who has consistent integrity and accept help. edit: word.",1690828003.0

Either epsom salt baths or I liked the magnesium citrate tablets that you dissolve in a glass of water. The intrusive thoughts and fear are tough, I would imagine therapy would be your best bet there. Specifically an addiction counselor or someone that understands benzo addiction and withdrawal. Personally I just distracted myself as much as possible during that period. Watched TV all night, anything to take me out of my head and forget the hell I was going through. I would find myself spiraling, reading all the horror stories of PAWS etc and it always made things worse. So try to avoid that as much as possible and just distract yourself if you can. Avoid alcohol as it will prolong the withdrawals. Some people recommend gabapentin while others say to avoid it, so talk to a doctor about that but it could help.",1690824973.0

ju793je,"So i had 5 years one time, and have really struggled to put any time together again until the last year and a half-ish. Something I really struggled with is 12-steps focus on something I did being at the root of all my problems, which is false. being a victim of CSA (which i suspect happened to most folks in the rooms), being on the receiving end of extreme childhood bullying, genetics, and not being neurotypical are not my fault. Alcoholism/addiction is a lifelong, chronic, relapsing disease. While that is not an excuse to slip, it is the reason you should forgive yourself after a relapse. The social aspect of 12-step groups helps me a lot, and the self-blame does not. I’ve found my niche within that, and I’m doing my work to stay healthy.

ju6mchu,"That is great u did not relapse most importantly!! But honestly i say time. Also im not sure what u were using but your brain needs more then two months to put itself together. Drugs block of emotions and without it and newly being clean those emotions will be heightened and your brain will have a harder time coping with them. I had to cut everyone out of my life, it took me about 6 months of being in this fog like state to feel “normal” again. You and your body is gonna have to re learn again how to deal with these stresses and pain. Do u have a work environment that you can make friends with? Staying busy really helps. Go to the the gym, go on hikes, and i think the best medicine is getting a dog if u don’t already have one. They will give you the most unconditional love. And it helps with structure as well taking care of them. At least it helped me. Going to talk therapy helps. Just getting out of the house and getting that nice vitamin d.

ju5v0pb,"As far as I know the timeline can vary, but Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS) is pretty common for up to a year. 3 months of usage isn’t too long at least, people take them daily for years and then quit and are able to live normal lives after. Were you taking them daily, and how rapidly did you taper or did you quit cold turkey? The faster the taper the worse the withdrawals will be. I spent about a year taking clonazolam daily. Had to taper very rapidly and essentially quit cold turkey. Think I went from 1.5 mg per day to 0 in less than a week. Withdrawals were terrible initially. First few days were awful as I’m sure you’re aware. No sleep, felt like worst acid trip of my life without any of the fun parts. Could hardly talk, shaky and twitching, completely shot nerves etc. After maybe a week I was still a wreck but without much of the physical symptoms from those first few days. I didn’t really feel back to normal for at least a year maybe two. Was very anxious and irritable, felt a bit slow, bad memory etc. It’s hard to say how much was PAWS and how much was just the anxiety that I was no longer treating. That being said, after a year I had gotten a job and was working customer service where I was able to be friendly with customers and coworkers. Just know it will pass, you’ve done the difficult part and should be seeing improvements over time. Maybe talk to a doctor if you haven’t already, see if they have any suggestions for how you can improve your recovery. You can ask them about Acamprosate. It’s used to help recover from alcohol addiction, and alcohol has similar effect on the brain as benzos. Physical exercise and therapy will help as well. Since you mentioned wishing you had gone to rehab, you could try NA or AA meetings if you’re up for it. That could provide you the community support that you’re missing. For what it’s worth, I felt a lot slower for a year or so after quitting but 3 years later I ended up going to college and getting a STEM degree. My memory still isn’t great but I still smoke weed too so that’s probably why.",1690777176.0

(I hope I'm making sense) The group was small 5-6 women and the counselor was basically there to keep it moving or get it going then let us have our own time with whatever we were talking about that week. It definitely helped me in dealing with things as I had no idea that I even had PTSD and that in itself was a problem when trying to stay clean.

You have to remember that going back to using will not enhance your life but rather make everything 100x worse. You may feel good for a short time with the first couple highs but those will fade and you will only feel worse in the long run. Is there anyway you can go back to grad school? If you have a goal or something you’re trying to pursue it can help with feelings of hopelessness. I would also recommend going to talk to a therapist or people in a support group who can process your feelings. Jointing an NA group is a great way to meet like minded people who can help support you through your darkest days on your recovery journey.

Meeting with them a lot, getting mental health help and living a one day at a time lifestyle. He is an addict. I am an addict.

My girlfriend dumped me because her life meant more to her than my bullshit. That was awesome (not at the time) but good for her. She was right. Many of my friends told me to pound sand. they were right. I was a junky and stealing every day for my habit was normal. I changed and became a shell of a human being. Everything I gave away and I got a new life. It is sometimes easier to change when you know you're going to die and welcome it and something or someone intervenes to change what seems inevitable. I was lucky. That was 21 years ago. Still sober. Go get yourself a therapist and find out about co-dependency and why you stay with someone who doesn't care enough about you or them to actually change. It's worth a try. You owe it to you. Be your own person.

He can start by going back to his old hobbies and what not, the ideea here is just to fill in the void created by the lack of drug use. Anything is a step forward, going to the gym, taking walks, meditating, learning something you always wanted, etc. The main ideea here is not just doing things so he doesn't get bored, it is about putting something new, that means a something to him, in that void.

For a lot of people in recovery, abstinence is the thing that helps them begin to do the work. But the work that would help you address your “why” that leads to misuse of Vyvanse and Adderall is not contingent upon 100% soberiety.

jto9mx0,"Ever since I got clean and quit drinking my social juice went down. I also get anxiety and sometimes panic attacks before I have to go into a function I know will have booze or drugs. But when I go out and I see everyone else having to be drunk to make a convo I realize that maybe it isn’t me who can’t socialize? Maybe they’re just not interesting people also scared to just be themselves. Society has centered alcohol for every single event, what’s helped me is stand my ground and not feel ashamed. If I have to bring mineral water to the function I will, and if I have to leave early cause I’m uncomfortable I will. What you’re doing is to save your life, and even tho rn it feels like life is unbearably hard, it’s still not what it could be and not what it used to be. That alone keeps me moving. I have very difficult days where I wish I could go have a drink n call it a day, but it wouldn’t solve my issues, if anything I’d wake up feeling worse for throwing it all way for nothing. Remember that right before things change for us in amazing ways, the old parts of our lives have to break away and dissolve and sometimes that hurts. I say you get it over with, get your boxes, cut that man off, maybe file a complaint for ur neighbor up stairs or get something to ventilate the stench for now, and move on with your professional career. Sobriety can be lonely but soon you’ll find your people, there’s millions of us out there. Go to a group if you want, even a zoom one works if you don’t wanna leave ur house or turn on ur camera, and vent and listen to other stories sharing the same difficulties as you.

Strictly speaking, sobriety is about being ok with NOT being ok. Medication assisted treatment might improve the quality of life for some people, but I also think it helps people circumnavigate the issues that led them to a path of abuse in the first place.

Finding a counselor that specializes in substance use disorder treatment, one that you can form a connection with, can help you develop the tools you need for self assessment, as well as the language needed to discuss the issue with your loved ones, or whoever ends up being part of your support network. If medication assisted treatment isn't available in your particular situation, just keep in mind that relapses can be a part of the process. The idea is, don't let lapses turn into relapses, and if you do relapse, try to keep the length of the relapse as short as possible. Getting back into treatment should always be your main goal if you ever relapse.",1690444539.0

Being social in general is just rough. The alcohol part never really helped me. I have a ~20 to ~30 minute social gas tank and the only thing that has helped has been sticking to small gatherings with at least one known person, and giving myself permission to leave at any time. And it's kind of ridiculous how much over consumption of alcohol is encouraged in some places. Like, small mixers can be so casual that no one notices who is and who isn't drinking. I also wish it was like that more often but seems like most people have a different relationship with booze and accept it as the normal ""social lubricant"".

But first of all well done on getting out your comfort zone, really well done!! It was a shot and even though you enjoyed it , maybe it was too much especially with alcohol there, also I’m not sure if you went alone? Maybe having a like minded friend there to confide in while you were starting to panic might have helped. Im sure with your courage you can possibly now go do something we’re people aren’t drinking and that also combats anxiety, like yoga or boxing/swimming or anything like this. There you might meet people more like minded and also could go ace throwing with after you get comfortable with whoever you meet.

jtlzrcw,"Everyone, thank you so much for your comments and your opinions. They mean a lot to me and they have given me a lot to think about as I continue my road in sobriety. There are some bottles of whiskey I have kept as some people have mentioned because they were my late fathers and I will never open them even if I am desperate for alcohol because a few of them were gifts from me to him and I don't think it's right to drink a gift you meant for someone else even if they have passed on. That being said, I think I'm definitely going to try some of these alternatives for alcohol because I definitely deeply miss Japanese and French cuisine one because my dad was really big into French cuisine and taught me how to cook coq au vin and a few other French dishes as well as he gave me a wonderful recipe for how to cook mussels. The Japanese portion is more of my own passion. It's just something I have taken a knack to being able to cook well and enjoy cooking. But for instance ingredients such as mirin, I've already used the kikkoman version that's alcohol free compared to traditional mirin which is like 15% alcohol. I have not noticed a tangible taste difference. And that has made me happy. But I wanted to say thank you to all of you that have posted and given your thoughts and opinions on this because it has helped a lot. So bless all of you.

He may have a legitimate desire to quit but this attempt most likely isn't going to stick and I'm almost entirely sure he knows that and knew before jumping off methadone at such a high dose. It's hard to imagine a long-term opioid addict that wouldn't. Maybe the Suboxone shots(sublocade I assume?) will help because they last months and at the typical doses used do block other common opioids from binding well enough. The way he's going about the switch may work in the end but is the worst and least sustainable way to go about this. The fact he jumped from such a high dose seems to me like an excuse to use street opioids for a while before getting on sublocade but that makes the chances of him actually getting on the shots a lot lower.

Regardless of what you feel causes your addiction, I firmly believe successful recovery comes down to changing the way we view and interact with the world. Usually we can't accomplish this on our own and do need some kind of suggestions/ideas/advice.

Your bf ODing in front of you, then having to give him CPR IS NOT NORMAL AND ITS NOT OK. Therapy isn’t just for addicts like your bf. It’s for all of us to find out why we make the poor and often extremely harmful to us decisions we make. You can’t save your bf.

It sounded really annoying and like “ok yeah that will do zero for me” when I first got the advice but when I just sucked it up and did it, I felt so much better bc I was focusing on positive things instead of negative.

jt063y4,"First. It’s not really “rehab”, meaning you won’t be rehabilitated when the IOP ends. Next, take full advantage of everything they offer. Suit up, show up, and participate honestly. Insurance will probably pay for anywhere from 30 - 60 days. Not everyone will be there for recovery - many people are forced to go to IOP, so stay away from the people who are ‘too cool for this bullshit”. You don’t have time to fuck around. You have work to do, so stick with others who are serious about their recovery. Addiction is a complicated, many faceted beast. Some parts are or could be: YOUR THINKING. Your thought patterns that lead you to using/ drinking are well worn - those neuro pathways are deeply grooved. RITUAL. All of the little things you do before, during and after you use help walk you back the next time. SOCIAL. Addicts often build their lives around using. So many friends, places you go, and things you do are designed to get you drunk/high. MENTAL/BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES, ESPECIALLY TRAUMA. We all have these. Either were self medicating an undiagnosed or under/untreated mental behavioral health issue - or we picked one or more up living the life of an addict. I know this seems like a lot, but don’t be discouraged. YOU can recover. I know this because anyone who has the mental capacity to dedicate themselves to the recovery recovers. I wrote all of that out to impress upon you that one of the main things to focus on is how do you continue your recovery process after IOP ends. Inpatient Treatment and IOP are ways of beginning the recovery process rather than completing it.

jszaloa,"Buprenorphine is not an effective analgesic (pain control medication) for non opioid naive patients (people who have used other opioids in the past) because Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist, it doesn't fully bind to the opioid receptor sites. In most cases where acute pain control is needed, like in case of surgery, the typical recommendation is to taper off the Buprenorphine, then get back on it after the procedure and acute recovery from the procedure is done. As others here have mentioned, discuss the situation with the doctor that's prescribing you the Buprenorphine, and the doctors involved in your procedures. The naloxone in the medication is there to prevent people from injecting the Buprenorphine, because when taken sublingually, the naloxone doesn't pass the blood brain barrier and isn't active. I had an 18mm herniated disk in my lower back about 3 years into my active recovery, i was terrified of having to take the opioids to deal with the pain. My doctor told me to not worry about it, had me taper off the bupe for about a week, i ended up taking the opioids as prescribed for the time i needed them (in my case 3 weeks) i had a lot of support from my loved ones, like having my brother hold on to the medication to help make sure i had no issues with it. Once i got to the point where the pain was manageable with ibuprofen/non opioid meds, i went back on to Buprenorphine without any issues. The pain meds wont be as effective for the first few days, as the Buprenorphine has a really long half life and very high affinity for the receptors it binds to. After that, should work like normal.",1690019084.0
jszacvs,Best advice I got from a counselor in inpatient was. There is no lighting bolt. You can’t just ride out 28 days and be cured. Take advantage of every resource and opportunity available. Consider every suggestion given to you by those who are qualified. You don’t have to do everything they suggest. But seriously consider it. Define what it is you want to achieve by attending inpatient and do something every day you’re there that helps further that goal. Cuz as a good man once said I knew in rehab “this is the most expensive chair I’ve ever paid for. Not with money. But with pain and suffering and loss and regret.” You’ve got a real chance. A real chance at life now. You made the hard decision. Take that chance and run and hold onto it for dear life and don’t look back,1690018872.0

I hid my struggles with compulsion and addiction. My parents never knew, but could see the ramifications of my choices. That caused a lot of shame and further isolation. I do wish I had the parents that would stand in my corner of the ring even when the fight looks like it’s lost, help me up and support the fight. The connection we have with our community is a major key to overcoming the elements that lead us to addiction. It helps battle what we are taught: that we can have anything we want whenever we want it with very little wait. It provides us with an environment so rewarding that using is not at the top of the “like to do list”. It’s something I didn’t have through a lot of my adolescence and recovery. But I can to life on the road to sobriety and now have built a tribe that satisfies my evolutionary need for community and all that goes with it. The goal being that my children will have a life so rich, that substance just becomes another aspect, a tool, medicine when needed, and not a focus. I don’t know if any of that helps. We are all on a different journey here. But the simple common facts of the matter is, the things that drive us to use (whatever DOC) are complicated, buried deep and will take time to iron out and heal. It’s a process and a practice for life, never finished but always advanced upon. I hope that you are your husband help your son find a path that leads to healthy growth and life improvement beyond anything either of you three can imagine at this point in time. It IS possible.

Without the support of parents, a lost child (no matter the age) can literally become lost for life. Homeless with no desire to have a home, hooked on fentanyl cause that’s what’s on the streets, slowly destroying the structure of the brain until recovery is nearly unattainable. I think this parent has the right heart and right idea and is smart for seeking advice and assistance. That’s not to say there isn’t a point, when you’ve worked and worked, and tried your best to help guide your child back to healthy standards, that there won’t be a time to say “go live your life the way you choose”. It has to be a conscious choice after all the options have been understood. Many people become functionally dependent and source their own substance, and live productive lives with addiction, by choice. And sometimes, that may be the best way a child can spend their adulthood. But we all strive for our kids to have more freedom and personal autonomy than that. And that should be the goal until all options are exhausted.",1689984977.0

jswf6vm,"First of all, I don't know what you mean by ""normal person"", second I definitely believe it's a logical and smart thing to be self-aware of how much of a substance you are intaking. If you go on the street and ask any person(if there are two people, 1 takes one sip of beer every day for 3 years, and the other gets drunk every day for 1 year. who is the alcoholic?) even though both of these people consumed alcohol daily people will still say the one who got drunk every day for a year is the alcoholic purely because of the amount of alcohol this person ingested.

You will unfortunately need to completely stop supporting him and force him to face the consequences of his addiction. I don't want to sound like a conservative prick or anything but it's an unfortunate reality that addiction turns us into worst version of ourselves and we will sell our very souls for opiods. Be resolute and stand firm, take away every option other than sobriety, then be prepared to deal with the fall out. He will hate you, he will suffer but he can recover once he has suffered enough to appreciate sobriety. That dounds harsh I know but I am 5 years sober from opiod use.

Wouldn’t give me money. I couldn’t go to their house by myself anymore, if I was able to go at all. Finally, I decided to go on the methadone clinic. Mainly just so I could use without getting sick and make it look like I was trying when I wasn’t. And it saved my life.

You are absolutely right and OP needs to understand is everyone's rock bottom is different. Mine was a DUI, my grandmother and best friend's reaction, my kid being scared and getting the shit beat out of me by the cops. I have a friend who lived on the streets and chose to stay in them when her family offered to let her come home. She would've rather had close access to drugs. Other's rock bottom is 6 feet under. You can't make him hit his. If you have anything he may can get high off of or drink, I would suggest a lock box or putting it somewhere in accessible to him. If you have anything of value or money, store it away too. My best friend had put several locks on her door so her brother couldn't get in. He had a habit of pawning her stuff. &#x200B; Those boundaries are so important. Talk to other family members he may reach out to for help and make them not only aware, but talk to them about boundaries too. Follow through. If you tell him you're going to do something, ask him to leave, or anything...follow through. Don't let him manipulate you. &#x200B; Protect yourself. We get angry and some get violent when they are coming down. If that happens, don't be afraid to call the cops. Yeah, he'll get locked up. Maybe that's what he needs. My DUI saved my life. It wasn't just the thing that made me go to treatment but the night I got my DUI, I was going to turn my first trick so I had money for drugs. I didn't want to but I wanted the drugs more. I not just got a DUI, but it was 5 minutes from my house...and I rear ended a cop car. But a friend in treatment told me, yeah, it fucking sucked...getting arrested is never fun and the fact that it was a cop was terrifying but.... I could've been killed. I could've been kidnapped, and going through with turning a trick would've changed and fucked my life up even more. And today, I am grateful for that day. DUI was Sept. 13th 2020. Went to rehab Sept. 17th 2020. My sober date is Sept. 14th 2020. I'll hit 3 years this year. &#x200B; I'm thinking about you and your family and your son.

jsu7rdn,"Clean 20+ years and I am a recovery coach. First and foremost - do you have Narcan in your house? Narcan will revive a person who has overdosed on opiates. This is critical, as your son is in great risk of OD because many opiates have Fentanyl in them which is 50x stronger than heroin. He can do his normal dose of opiates, and have unknowingly taken a lot more. Narcan is over the counter through any pharmacy. If for any reason you can’t get it, call your Dr and have them write you a prescription. Google ‘signs of opiate overdose’ so you know what to look for. If you revive your son with Narcan it is imperative that you still take him to the ER, as he can fall back into OD when the Narcan wears off. It sounds like you and your husband are loving parents and you’ve already tried much of what I’d have recommended. Addiction is extremely complicated. Causes can be caused or exacerbated by many different issues: mental/behavioral health, social, genetic, trauma, and others. It’s often a combination of some of these. Unfortunately, that is the reason why there’s no one answer to addiction. So often someone has to treat multiple issues simultaneously. There are a few things that people who recover from anything, not just addiction, have in common. They have the belief and can admit that they have a problem that they cannot solve alone, that they need help. This leads to the next commonality which is they then have the willingness to accept that help and take the actions that are provided. You probably know or intuited this already, so your question is really ‘how can I get my son to see what is so obvious to us, and anyone else who knows him well.’ What we’re taking about is what people call “hitting bottom” or “having a moment of clarity”. This is what cuts right through the addicts lies and delusions, and allows them to acknowledge the reality of their situation. I think the term “bottom” is unhelpful, as we are talking about the destruction of a mental and emotional facade, often brought about by extreme emotional pain, rather than something that happens to their physical world such as jail, homelessness, or overdose. While those physical realities can absolutely contribute to anyone’s emotional distress, I’ve seen people flatline in the ER, get revived, and go right back out to get high. Someone else may get a dui and run to AA and never touch another drop of alcohol. I personally had to be at the end of my emotional rope. I had plenty of money, but I ended up intensely unhappy and had ever increasing levels of suicidal ideation. When I couldn’t bring myself to end it all, I realized that I didn’t want to die, I just couldn’t live and feel the way I was feeling for one more day. I knew I had to stop drinking and drugging, but I also knew that was impossible for me to do. I couldn’t go forward or backward and I definitely couldn’t stay where I was. That was the moment my lies all shattered, and I wanted help for the first time in my life. I’ve been clean from that day to this one. I did AA and CA for 5 years or so. I learned many helpful things, but 12-step recovery ended up not being a good fit for me. So, how do you provide that moment of clarity for your son? I think you already know that it’s not in your power to do that. If it was, all of your love and effort would have succeeded. You and your husband working with a therapist who specializes in both family therapy and addiction should be helpful for you both. For your son, Boundaries. Consequences for violating said boundaries enforced with love, but enforced. You are allowed to set conditions on your time and money related to your son. Your son will likely manipulate you and say that ‘you don’t love me’ when you enforce your boundaries, but protecting yourselves from the madness of addiction is not lack of love. The only advice you can take without consideration is getting the Narcan, and therapy for you and your husband. Every other piece of advice you should thoroughly understand and consider. While I hope this doesn’t happen, if your son should pass from addiction it will be your face accusingly starting back at you in the mirror. So Learn what you can about addiction and what it does to the family. Understand that no matter what you do, your son must be the one to choose help.",1689925145.0
jsu5dac,"Tough love is very popular in the USA. But, there is no benefit to cutting someone off from their support network. It just makes the person more vulnerable and more isolated. In modern countries there is something called Harm Reduction. Harm Reduction is the leading theory in managing opioid addiction. Opiate addicts are statistically more likely to successfully get help and quit when they have more ties and more family support in their lives than less. And, the more times they try to quit, the better their chances. Let me say that again, the more times an opiate addict attempts to quit, the better their chances of success. Trying, failing, relapsing, trying again, building clean time in little spurts is the path to recovery. Addicts are emotionally dependent on a drug. Most therapy is not helping a person build life skills. Basic skills about how to exist in the world. And, for an addict, existing without opiates is painful. It is confusing and painful. Just because your son has tons of potential, that doesn't mean he knows how to do simple things. And simply throwing him in the deepend, or to the wolves, is only going to traumatized him further. So yes, you could cut him off. Throw him out. Make your commitment to him dependent on whether or not he is abstaining from opiates. That is one option and the result of that is years of trauma, possible jail or death. Or, you could help him using the principles of Harm Reduction. First you can try sublocade or suboxone. Then, if that doesn't work, methadone. He might relapse occasionally while on these types of therapies. But, you have to look at the time in between the relapses and see if there is growth. An addict needs his family to see him and treat him as more than his addiction. If you want him to succeed, your statistically most effective strategy is Harm Reduction.",1689923293.0
jsth8xz,"You sound like a very loving and caring person and your stepson and husband are lucky to have you. I got clean initially at 24 after getting arrested for a major crime. My parents were very supportive; I had put them through so much but they were still there for me when I really needed it. This is almost 30 years ago now and I have spent most of the time in recovery—I am a huge advocate of 12 step programs (more later) but relapsed after 13 years because I stopped going to meetings. When I had a c section, my unaddressed addiction came back full force and I was stuck in active addiction for a few hellish years. My story is not so important, not sure why I am even telling it…the main suggestions I have as a recovering addict who now has a 19 year old and a 16 year old is that you should try to take care of yourself first, through Nar Anon or Al Anon, possibly with therapy too. This situation is greatly affecting you and your husband and you guys need help yourselves. You will learn a lot in these groups, mainly that very sadly you cannot control anyone else’s disease. There’s tons of support from other parents and spouses etc too. As far as your son, medication assisted treatment can be very effective as can inpatient treatment along with 12 step recovery programs. There are more and more young people coming into the programs now. I was not as young as your son but at 24 I was miserable at the thought of life without drugs. What helped me the most was the friendships I developed in my 12 step program. I met other younger people who were clean and cool too! It made me keep going to meetings and work a recovery program.

To be honest, I know they were just trying to help and show me unconditional love but all they did was make it take longer for me to hit the bottom I needed to hit. It wasn’t until they completely cut me off that I hit my bottom. It took an overdose and then another 2 weeks of destroying my life some more to finally realize I can’t do it anymore. Every addict needs to hit THEIR bottom and no one knows what that will be. For some, it’s parents cutting them off, for others it’s homelessness, imprisonment or overdose etc. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with helping as long you have clear and hard boundaries and he is willing to get the help he needs. But he needs to understand that if he uses again their will be severe consequences. No compromises. I’m so sorry you’re going through this.

There, you will see a glimpse of what other parents and loved ones of addicts are going through, and have gone through, and what you may go through if you don’t take action. But also you will find support and community because the reality is this fight is not yours. Yes I suggest rehab but not everyone is ready and only some rehabs are able to “make” someone ready.

The other lived in his car in a major city and begged on the street for almost a year, he’s now in methadone therapy and living with his girlfriend. I don’t know if he’s truly clean. My advice is to take care of yourself and your spouse. This is hard on a relationship. You will need support and you need to make sure you’re okay and ready when your child is ready.

jsoboe6,"I'm in the same exact boat.... I've got over three years clean from meth and heroin/fent..... But for all intensive purposes my life hasn't changed that much..... Other than the fact of I do not associate with anybody who messes with either of those things in any capacity. For the life of me, I don't know what I want to do with myself anymore. I have ideas about what I wanna do. But I am having a hard time committing to anything. I had to seek out treatment. I'm currently going to counseling and some drug classes. I hadn't relapsed and I didn't want to relapse but I had to get plugged back in. I think we are an important bone in the backbone of recovery my friend..... I don't know. I guess I kind of got sold on the idea of when you got sober, everything changes......it's not like that though. There's a coalescence of ideas that are occurring In my life right now, One is that I really don't like how business is done a lot of times and I do not like how people behave towards one another, Another is that I have created a persona in active addiction That the public at large can perceive in a number of fashions.(I have drug manufacture, theft, deception(obstruction)and violence on my record). I never worked for the cops but I was approached to do it. And I am convinced that this has also segregated me in some capacity that i'm not even fully aware of, call that intuition. I also never worked with any organized criminal elements in any capacity. To go with what I said in the beginning of this paragraph. I don't like the way people do business with each other. I figured out people really just walk all over each other and do some really grimy things. This happens in the legal world and the illegal world. And I do not like it at all. In fact, I can't even willingly contribute to activity like that without serious threat to my sobriety.. So basically I don't play well with others in the way. Power is structured currently in our modern society a lot of times. Keep sticking it out bro. I have this feeling and when I get feelings like this, Normally they're truth.... But we are important cogs in this whole mechanism of recovery for our society today. People need to see that recovery can look a lot of Different ways. And that all that matters is that you're abstaining from whatever it is that poisons you and then in turn the world around you...... Basically I know we're doing more for ourselves and society than what we realize. I'm 42. I used meth for the first time when I was 18. The last time I used was The middle of may in 2020. The first time I used was sometime around May of 1999. I've seen a lot of different incarnations of the dope scene in those decades. I know instinctively when I see people who are in their late teens, early 20s and just like I was when I got sucked into all of this. I know instinctively that part of my purpose is to help them from ever getting sucked into the things that I got sucked into period I don't even have kids. That's something my addiction stole for me. Just like having a significant other. Or a family. But my sense of duty and responsibility to my fellow man is as strong as it has ever been. And I know instinctively that what I'm doing is not just good for me. But it's good for those kids. I'm telling you right now, That my generation is the last generation. That's going to go through things. The way that we did this new generation will not be exposed in the same ways that we were exposed period this is a big change period it's bigger than any of us. Can fathom myself included period I don't think most people really can't even begin to wrap their mind around how big of a change this is going to be.",1689818741.0

Always reaching out or sharing what's really going on with me is likely the reason I've stayed sober many years. Second, I suggest you get a sponsor who has years of sobriety and knows the 12 Steps. It does not matter whether its someone you meet online or in person. Last, I suggest you create a daily routine for yourself. This structure will help protect your sobriety even after these things which are causing pass. The first thing I do when I wake up is make my bed. The second thing I do is ask my HP to keep me sober today. I connect with my guys who are on this journey with me. Oh and I always know which meeting I will attend that day. The last thing I do at night is thank my HP for keeping me sober today. Those in recovery know there's more to a daily routine, but those are my daily actions no matter what.

jsnote3,"I can’t tell you what I think you should do. But I just want to point out the fact that you’ve recognized these feelings to the point of consideration and putting it to words: that says to me you still have some foundation in recovery/healthier thinking. You’ve said that you’re uncomfortable/not very happy right now, to say the least, and for that, I’m sorry. But our thoughts lead to emotions for a reason. Emotions indicate needs to our conscious mind. Just for simple example, are you familiar with that acronym “H.A.L.T?” It’s a pneumonic device for trying to discern uncomfortable emotions. If you are feeling depressed, anxious, or discontent with life, it’s often recommended to consider those four factors first: hungry, angry, lonely, tired. Sometimes it helps me realize that one of those simple things is the cause of my emotional state. If so, it gives me crystal clear direction about my need: “Did I skip lunch?” and consequently the appropriate action: “I need to eat something.” But the emotions you’re describing are far more complex. And something that’s changed my life in recovery is the improved discernment of my own needs. And understanding that dynamic: emotions➡️ needs➡️ action. It sounds like you’re having a lot of uncomfortable emotions. What are they telling you? It sounds like they’re clearly indicating some deeply personal needs. Clarifying those needs will help you move forward to actions to address them. Of course I can’t know specifically what they are for you, but I’m glad you’ve had this “crisis of consideration” before relapsing. You say you need change. My best advice is to consider all of your uncomfortable emotions, and what needs they’re indicating. Perhaps going to an in-patient would address them all and is exactly what would be best for you? Maybe it’s other life changes? Self-clarifying on these kinds of things is challenging. Ime, it’s much more productive to talk through with someone else good. Some of the emotions you’ve described — confusion, uncertainty and fear — for me personally, would indicate a need for connection. If I felt this way, I would reach out to a trusted resource (hopefully you still have some from the beginning of your recovery; if not, you can message me and I may be able to help identify some options). Congratulations on the changes you’ve made that have brought you to this point. Recovery and emotional maturity aren’t linear. Listen to your needs so you can act on them in way that matches your values: it’s all we can do. 💞",1689808534.0

I would maybe start off with you telling them your concerns about them drinking and driving, if this person ever gets a DUI or DWI it will turn their lives upside down and they could potentially spend years paying lawyers, the court, the dmv and they’ll have to go on probation or task… and of course they will lose their license (they might allow them to go to and from work but they will have to pay for a breathalyzer to be installed in their car, it’s a monthly fee, and after a heavy night of drinking don’t bother… people don’t realize how long alcohol stays in the system, esp heavy drinkers, she will be screwed) oh and did I mention her car insurance will go wayyyyyyyyyyyy up and mind you that’s if she’s lucky that no one else gets hurt. I got a DWI, thankfully no one got hurt (I was speeding like crazy though, it could have ended badly) and drinking and driving is one of the most irresponsible, selfish and dare I say abusive/violent things you can ever do, you are operating a heavy piece of machinery under the influence of alcohol, when you drink and drive you are turning you and your car into a deadly weapon, she needs to stop this right away and learn how to Uber if she wants to party and drink and go out. I feel bad for her, you’re not drinking the way she is just for fun, she needs professional help. Some people are all about “brutal honesty”, and the people best at that kind of honesty are mental health professionals… not friends, there’s a reason for that.

jse5vyr,"I'm from Costa Rica, so we don't have a lot of the drugs you guys have over there. Opiates, for example, are not common, nor is heroine or fentanyl easy to get. There's a lot of crack though, but I never smoked it. Basically I was using a lot of marihuana and ocasional cocaine. But also at some point a lot of mushrooms. I suffered a psychotic crisis in 2020 after a couple of years of enduring paranoia and ocasional allucinations. I know it's rare, but I think heavy smoking of pot for around twelve years affected me. I probably have a previous condition that makes me more suceptible to these psychic alterations by drugs. There's a history of mental illness in my family, on my mothers side (suicide and depression). So regarding these discussions, very common in NA, about being an addict or not, or just having a mental problem for example, I mean I really don't know. But my paranoia and allucinations are completely controllable since I quit drugs. And also, I tried a lot of times to quit and couldn't, always relapsed. This time I got help from a pretty decent clinic, a psychiatrist, and NA, and was able to quit. I feel good about it and I'm very thankful. I mean, I never really went mad over drugs but I smoked all the time and used cocaine and other stuff when the opportunnity presented itself. So, am I an addict? I think on some level yes, but I also don't really care a lot about fitting the definition. Sometimes I feel people with addiction problems get to the absurd point of feeling thankful for being an addict. But anyway, I talk to a sponsor every 15 days and go to a meeting once or twice a week and completely avoid the controversies. I agree there's a lot of problems with ""the program"". And I'm not that surprised with this story about famous Bill. It's kinda typical isn't it? Cult master is a total disaster... That feeling of it being a sect is what most bothers me about NA. It's so awkward. My strategy has been to identity two or three persons with whom to share and empathize. Then when I share at the meeting I kinda ritually express my being thankful for getting over those dark couple of years, and talk about what's going on with my life, but don't go to deep into it. My family has basically helped me. Starting with my father and mother that let me live at their house (I'm already 36) and one of my brothers that has been helping me with some work. I mean, I just ""partied"" (although there was not much partying, and more like some kind of ""schizo-vagrancy"" or something) for more than a decade, and could never find a job, a career or a partner. And now I feel like I just finished high-school... So well, pretty demoralizing, but I'm conscious it could be so much worse. And also, I completely disagree with this NA idea that the period of your life while you were using is meaningless. I couldn't disagree more. I was onto something. And I've been recovering my ""search"", slowly, from a more rational, careful and loving way. I'm the same person that I was five years ago, only a LOT more sociable, agreeable, reasonable, and so forth. I empathize with your critics of NA, about the weaponization of moral for example. It's so dark! But again, I guess for me it's a start. That's why I'm definitely looking for alternative ways to living without drugs. And it's hard, because I periodically hear the ""fuck-it-all"" call, ""the call of the wild"" or whatever. But no man, I don't think that's the true way. It's just a whirlind of images and sensations, pleasure and pain with no ethical content, no will, or consciousness, no being. I don't know, maybe I may sound too drastic. Probably compensating my actual desire to use. But I guess commitments always have some self-inflicted repression in them. I always felt that like a giant loss of spontaneity. To my amazement I've been slowly recovering that spontaneity. Paradoxically, after some hardcore acceptance of life being shit, things are getting better, or I'm getting used to it. How do you deal with it? Hope you are well!",1689640480.0
jsbrnkt,"Above everything else, congratulations on your clean time. As if it hasn’t been said many times before, let me hit you with the standard “how’d you do, it?” Seriously. I’m proud of you. What was your DOC? I don’t need to be branded a part of a fellowship to shake your hand in heartfelt solidarity and ask about your struggle. As for to the question of group support … I found the meetings clannish and cliquish. The group seemed more interested in recruiting members and retaining them, than in actually helping me stay the course. They love to brag, especially about how they’ll “love you till you love yourself.” But if I was in a pinch and I called a few numbers just to be heard/vent, well, they dropped me like a hot potato. One of my sponsors told me that it was because speaking to others when I’m struggling can be interpreted as me implying the program isn’t working. And so the end result was being shunned. I can’t speak directly to the NA program, since most of my book learning took place in AA, but the Big Book explicitly mentions over and over that the primary purpose of the book is to help you find a power greater than yourself to absolve you and remove your addiction. Plus the biographical accounts of Bill Wilson, even the ones coming straight outta Central Office, paint a picture of a charlatan grand standing abusive swindling jerk that died — check this out — being forcibly held down on his death bed so that he couldn’t reach a bottle of …. You guessed it … it was alcohol. LOL. He was a Joseph Smith type (you lost the the tablets, STFU!!!) or on par with an L Ron Hubbard. It’s a tried and true approach to wealth, creating a religion and duping people. I mean, Bill Wilson says straight up in the first pages of the Big Book “I was a speculator.” And what do they do for a living? They round up groups of people (they call them Rubes) with vastly inflated promises of future benefit. They collect their money. And then they run off with money they stole from the Rubes. He did that in the stock market. And he did that with AA. I thought the literature from both AA and NA was pure drivel. edit: Not trying to change anyone’s mind here. I have a profound respect for other’s process. And I’m only offering criticism to add to the conversation. Again, not to argue. And if you feel like contributing here with discursive attacks on my humble offerings then please I insist. Out with it. Rip me up into little shreds. Edit: The confession. 4th step. I see it as just another recycling of the the dogma of the Catholic Church, the papal bull Unum Sanctum, and the courts of the Inquisition. Some may see working a fourth step as you’re dredging out the guilt that holds you down, fair enough. But to me it reeks of the weaponization of morality. To me the fourth step is just recycled religious dogma. The fourth step is a confession. Bill Wilson simply plagiarized it from the Church and stuck in a different context.",1689605916.0
jsbr2zk,"When they first told me I’d have a life beyond my wildest dreams if I got sober, I looked around the room and noted that no one there seemed to be insanely wealthy. In the parking lot was the standard collection of commuter cars, beaters, work trucks and a few, nicer luxury cars. There were folks that were well-off, but certainly nothing beyond my wildest dreams. It was slightly confusing to me as a newcomer, to say the least. I just figured many of these folks had drank too much of the Kool-Aid and were settling for their lame, hokey lives instead of actual success. Over the months and years, It did slowly dawn on me that that a “good life” wasn’t only about money or success, but also an ability to be awake and unafraid, and to behave more in a manner of my ideal self. However, It really hit me one night some years ago when my toddler was really sick. My wife was wiped from taking care of my daughter all day, and I was awoken at 2-3 AM to my daughter crying. I walked into my kid’s room, picked her up, rubbed her back and head, dispensed some children’s Motrin to help bring the fever down and laid with her on my chest until she fell back asleep. None of which would have been possible (or advisable) before I got sober. Back then, especially at 2AM, I would have been insanely wasted or passed out, too sick myself, or angered that I was being disturbed. I certainly wouldn’t have wanted the old me dispensing medication or caring for a toddler at that point. I felt love and concern instead of craving and anger, and moreover, I was actually in a physical condition to care for a child. Laying there with my daughter at 2AM, watching her drift slowly from the pain of sickness to a peaceful slumber, feeling that perfect weight of her body on my chest, the soft rise and fall of her breath in unison with my own… and the perfect Wholeness all of that filled me with… You can’t bottle that, bag it, or otherwise manufacture that.

I read it, and it's ok, but I want to know more. It did got me interested in theology though. I'll look for those authors you mention.

js16w83,"Context: went through horrible withdrawals off pretty high dose of klonopin and then valium over about 4 years or so, so my GABA receptors are all wacky. I've had some mixed results when stopping. Shit's so expensive, and as someone with a major addictive personality, like so many others, I can't just have a drink or two of it, so I take a few days to a week or so off after a week of use. When I stop, USUALLY I'm just a little hungover feeling for a day or two, rarer sometimes I get a sinus infection (these are recurring in my life though, may just be my immune system being a little fucky, and the kava making it worse.) And lastly sometimes I get anxious, and I also suffer from bad GAD and SAD. Sorry you have such a bad reaction, maybe try and take breaks more often, like every other day or 2 days etc, if not quit altogether, although it's hard to deny that Kava can really help keep you steer clear from the nastier stuff out there. Oh! And maybe try a different strain.

Maybe you, Not accepting, according to your own experience, that you can't use without eventually having extreme consequences, and you haven't decided that you want to live differently is the main issue. Ask yourself which you'd prefer - That ""ewww"" look or continuing as you are. While Recovery Centers don't rehabilitate anyone, they do provide a safe place to fully detox and get yourself some clean time, which can help you make some helpful, rational decisions about your life and your future. You can recover regardless of the number of recovery centers you've been to. Get with some people who used to be where you are now in addiction, and hang out with them. Go see a therapist. The number one obstacle to recovery is a mental or behavioral health issue.

He said he just preferred AA to NA. I told him there was no problem with what he was doing. I realized some AA peeps would have a huge problem with what he was doing - in fact, it's those people from the big book studies we went to that made him feel bad about the way he was helping himself and other people stay both clean and sober.

jrjs41v,"I was handed this pamphlet a long time ago, it helped me by answering a lot of questions, it may help you too. This is from Narcotics Anonymous- From the original- Sponsorship IP 11 _HYPERLINK_ INTRODUCTION This pamphlet, based on our collective experiences, answers some of the most commonly asked questions concerning sponsorship. Although this pamphlet offers most of the essential information regarding sponsorship, it is not meant to be comprehensive. Rather, it presents a simple understanding of a vital tool in our program of recovery. ""Sponsorship is the heart of the N.A. way of recovery from addiction - one addict helping another."" ""Sponsorship is also a two-way street, helping both the newcomer and old-timer alike. "" My Gratitude speaks .. . When I care And when I share With Others The N.A. Way WHAT IS A SPONSOR? A sponsor is a recovering addict in the program of Narcotics Anonymous; someone we can trust to share our life experiences with (both good and bad); a person to whom we can go with our problems that may be too personal to share with the group. It is suggested that a sponsor be someone who has practice in working the 12 Steps and is involved in the Program. Primarily, a sponsor is a guide through the 12 Steps of Recovery. WHO NEEDS A SPONSOR? It is our experience that most addicts need a sponsor. At times we all find ourselves on shaky ground, confused, in emotional pain and in need of a helping hand. Since we rarely trusted others, we attempted to go it alone in life. This became one of our problems. We are people who have never learned how to live. This is where our sponsors come in. Our sponsors help by sharing their experience, strength and hope. To sum it up, anyone who may have the desire to stay clean and begin to recover should have a sponsor. HOW DO YOU GET A SPONSOR? Listening is the key to finding a sponsor. The most obvious place to look for a sponsor is at N.A. meetings. Talk, share, and listen to members of the Program; get plenty of phone numbers and USE them. When you find some-one with whom you can talk openly and relate, simply ask them to be your sponsor. Chances are the answer will be ""yes"". Some-times the person may be unable to sponsor you. Keep on trying! Remember that when one door closes, another will open. Continue to attend meetings, listen and soon you will find a sponsor. WHAT LENGTH OF CLEAN TIME SHOULD A SPONSOR HAVE? The answer to this question varies from person to person. The sponsor may be a member with years of clean time behind him, or may be only a few months in the Program. The sponsor's clean time and experience may well depend on the availability of sponsors in your area. The quality of time is more important than the quantity of clean time. Choose someone who has a firm grasp on the Twelve Suggested Steps of Recovery of N.A., seems reasonably happy, and has the willingness to help other recovering addicts. We call people like this ""winners"" and it is a good idea to find your sponsor among these recovering addicts. SHOULD A SPONSOR BE A FRIEND? Our experience has shown that a good sponsor relationship need not be based on friendships, but trust is vital. When looking for sponsors, we considered their experiences in life, the quality of their clean time, their availability to us, and their willingness to help. As trust deepens, friendship based on mutual respect often follows. SHOULD MY SPONSOR BE A MAN OR WOMAN? It is strongly suggested that we find a sponsor of the same sex. Experience has shown us that members of the same sex better understand certain issues such as sexuality, family or identity problems, relation-ship problems, etc. We are emotionally un-stable and it is easy to form emotional bonds with members of the opposite sex. This detracts from our program and could spell disaster, especially for the newcomer. SHOULD WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE SPONSOR? We think not! Our experience has shown that it's easier to receive direction from one individual. We find it easier to t rust in one person rather than many. With one sponsor we can learn t o build a relationship based on trust and honesty. Through shared experience a sponsor is able to reflect on personal growth. As we grow in the Program we learn to be more open and honest with others. Remember: Just for today I will have faith in someone in N.A. who believes in me and wants to help me in my recovery. HOW DO WE USE A SPONSOR? Communication is the key to this relationship. When we have questions about any part of our Program, we know we can look to our sponsor, but it is our responsibility to get in touch with them during these times. Whether it be by telephone or in person we share our problems with our sponsor. Good or bad we try to share our experiences on a daily basis. Day or night, whenever we feel the need, we contact our sponsor. It is important that we be honest with our sponsor; that we listen with an open mind to suggest-ions, and that we are willing to try a way other than our own. Remember, WE NEED NEVER BE ALONE. HOW TO BE A SPONSOR It is our experience that the decision to become a sponsor is an important step in our recovery and should not be taken lightly. We believe that whenever possible we consult our own sponsor before agreeing to sponsor someone else. In order to arrive at this decision, we might wish to explore our motives. Are we considering sponsorship to look good amongst the Fellowship or to help the addict who still suffers? Remember that we can only keep what we have by giving it away. Therefore, we may wish to consider the following questions: Am I ready to become a sponsor? Am I willing to share my experience, strength and hope? Am I willing to make a commitment? After having decided to become a sponsor, where do we go from here? We feel it is important to realize that our own recovery comes first. We believe that the basic purpose of sponsorship is to help the addict through the Twelve Steps of Recovery. It becomes increasingly obvious to us that the best way to do this is by example. Sponsorship is an extension of our own personal program of recovery. One of the most difficult aspects of sponsorship is drawing the line between caring and enabling. We feel it is enabling them when we work their program for them. It doesn't help the addict if their sponsor is overprotective. Sometimes tough love is essential to an addict's growth. We suggest that you keep in mind that it is our responsibility to carry the message, not the addict. We are not reformers, preachers of the gospel, welfare workers, part-time social workers, marriage counselors, money lenders, employment counselors, or parole officers. It is important to remember that we, are also suffering addicts. There may come a time when you are unable to relate to the person you sponsor. At this time you may direct them to someone who may help. We need not feel guilty if someone we sponsor relapses. We are all responsible for our own recovery. There will be times when we won't have the answers. It is our responsibility to seek these answers out with the people we sponsor. We are not GOD!!!",1689091010.0

That is why these things don't seem as enjoyable anymore. It sounds like you struggle a lot with discipline, which I do as well, which is probably why it is difficult for you to sustain the positive momentum of some of the new healthy habits you are trying to build. Therefore you kind of create a pattern of letting yourself down and probably feeling bad about yourself, negative affecting your self image and confidence, which in turn makes you less likely to enjoy being around other people because you are feeling insecure. &#x200B; 11 months is a great achievement, sometimes I have to take a step back and question myself as to why I am doing something. A lot of times I just build it up in my head as like ""I should do this, or I need to do this"" and then if I don't I feel like a failure. But sometimes it is helpful to remember the why behind what you are doing instead of just the menial task in itself. Like I am brushing my teeth because it will help prevent pain, loss of $$, I will look better, feel better about myself, etc. &#x200B; Best of luck my friend, it's not easy but it's worth it!",1689026854.0
jrg13jb,"I hear you. TBH I have borderline personality disorder. It was not pretty when I was untreated and uninformed. I truly feel sorry for you. I would not want to room with an untreated, newly sober me. I still feel that most true addicts have something going on, if not a personality disorder (usually borderline or something in that cluster) then at LEAST adhd and/or PTSD (which is sometimes almost indistinguishable from Borderline). The science backs this theory, as well. Not all, but most. You will see folks without these issues have a MUCH easier time getting and staying sober and can quickly move on with their life. Just protect yourself, don't react to her at all in the moment. Nothing you do will help. If she truly does have a personality disorder it's likely Narcissism or Borderline. They can be hard to tell apart. The key is that borderlines are much more vulnerable acting and capable of saying sorry. Honestly, I would switch rooms, but you may get another borderline. Not all of us are THAT bad, though. Some are so fucking nuts, though. Gosh, I really must be bored cause I'm rambling. Anyway, I'm really proud of you for staying sober.

That means that the newcomer’s sense of personal well-being is not more important than your own or the person with the exposed shoulders.

If people were bothered by the person on-camera they should have said so directly and called for a group-conscious. That’s right in Tradition 2.

jre89zc,"Talk to your boss. Tell them what you see. You might save someone's life. We've dealt with this twice in the last 2 years. I'm a supervisor and both guys were ""work friends"" that I was pretty close to. I had to be involved. The first was meth. My boss pulled him aside twice and told him if he just asks for help he'd get it and keep his job. He claimed he wasn't using drugs. She told me to gently try to talk to him which I wanted to do anyway. Every time I tried to get him alone he'd avoid it. Stopped talking to me outside of work. Sadly he ended up getting arrested and fired. The other we thought was drinking. After the meth guy I told my boss I would handle it, didn't want to lose another friend at work. He wasn't drinking, his liver was starting to fail but he didn't realize it. That was one of the hardest discussions I've ever had, begging him to seek medical attention and honestly saying that I care about him. He's been out of work for 7 months now and not doing well. In both cases if I didn't supervise these guys I still would've tried to get involved. No one at work knows my addiction history. Still if I see someone struggling I will try to help.

I had no choice but to tell our Chef. they were fired on the spot but offered help in getting into a rehab. they refused any help & I have not spoken to them since. it absolutely wrecks me, but I remember thinking I was fine in my deepest addiction, and I feel like I just have to let them be...(they're 47, btw.

A lot of their consequences weren’t always felt by them so I can understand why they may not always understand the seriousness of their addiction. We are at the point where I no longer plan to enable them in any way though. I am also not going to be around them when they’re lashing out or using.

Losing their home has been really hard on them.

jr93ipd,"I know that 12-Steppers will call addiction a 'spiritual malady', but what it really is is a mental and or behavioral health disorder. Obsessive thought and compulsive behavior(s) seem to fall into the latter. Often addicts, including myself, have a co-occurring disorder. Sometimes these preceded alcohol and drugs so we self-medicated. Other times we picked up some issues amongst the wreckage in our wake. Recovering from addiction requires the sufferer to gain an objective perspective on their lives. That means self-diagnosis of addiction, accepting accountability, and personal responsibility for their lives. An honest acknowledgment that the damage to our mental & emotional states, relationships, and finances is far worse than the 'feel good' moments on drugs could ever be. Now let's say an addicted person also has a co-occurring case of major depressive disorder. How could this person possibly be objective about themselves? It will be impossible for this person to stay clean unless they address the MDD in a meaningful way. I'm not saying you have depression, and I'm not a therapist.

After a really bad leg injury in early 2021 which resulted in a 46 day stay in the ER and 9 surgeries on my right leg alone I was given a script of oxycodone which was great at first! My leg is still not back to 100% I still have a lot of nerve damage in my leg and especially my foot so the meds definitely did help with that but eventually I started taking more than I was supposed to which led to taking more and more and I would run out of a 28 day script in like 7-10 days smh. Obviously I couldn’t go into my doctors office and ask for a refill b4 the 28 days were up but it wasn’t that big of a problem for me to wait it out. I’d buy some here and there off friends and other people I knew in between getting my new prescription but eventually it got so fucking outta hand that I was spending every single dollar I had on pills 🤦🏾‍♂️. Now after being on this medicine for almost 3 years I 100% need oxycodone to even feel like a productive person and be able to sleep at night or get out of bed in the morning. Thrust me, if you are just starting using opioids please do yourself a favor and stop as soon as u can (I know it’s easier said than done) but I promise you that you don’t want to end up dealing with this shit like I am at this point smh. The bad (withdrawals, not being able to sleep at night, not being able to get out of bed in the morning etc.) far outweighs the good!! I ignored all of the red flags and warning signs that I got along the way thinking that I could keep it under controll and wouldn’t allow it to get this outta hand but just like 99% of people that end up getting addicted to a substance it eventually caught up to me and now I have to pay back and go through the bullshit for the bad decision I made. Nothing in life is free and every action has a reaction and this is just the reaction to those bad decisions 🤷🏾‍♂️. In hindsight I could now say that it 100% was not worth the little highs I was getting to just end up having to suffer in the long run. If you could stop now please do, not for me but for yourself. To anyone out there that is struggling with addiction or suffering through withdrawals rn I wish you good luck and the strength to get thru this and get sober.

jr5zehb,"A person must ""lapse"" before they can ""Re-lapse"".There is no such thing as a ""chronic relapser"". The struggle ends when surrender begins. We can't struggle and surrender at the same time. We must choose one, or the other. Going back and forth is exhausting and fruitless. The process of surrender is the end result of working double overtime to find a solution that does not require giving up drugs completely. It is difficult to accept that drugs are the problem when we have not been able to find peace and serenity by any other means. When we make the decision to surrender, we get relief from the pain of making our own decisions. Surrender is positive for us because we find hope. Once we have surrendered, we open opportunities for other addicts to help us with our problems. Without understanding why, we get a sponsor, attend meetings and follow suggestions. We need to become willing to do anything to stay clean. Willingness is essential because we have to give our permission before change can occur. We must set aside our old thinking to open ourselves to new alternatives. The choice is up to us to change. Without our willingness, we never get to make the choice and remain tied up in many of our past limitations, illusions and habits. Once we become willing to put down the conviction that total abstinence is impossible and surrender to the fact that we are just like everyone else in NA then we can move forward with our commitment to staying clean. Once we surrender and become willing to do whatever is necessary to become abstinent, we need to stay committed to the process in order to not go back to the way of life we once knew. We need to make a commitment to a home group and stay clean no matter what. A commitment to a sponsor is also very important to this new way of life for we can not do this alone!!! There is no substitute for surrender. This may be very uncomfortable but we do it anyway because we know in our heart of hearts that this is the only way. Faith comes after this way of life becomes a reality. It comes to some quickly and to others slowly. If we are still clinging to the idea that we can use drugs, this way of life can not come at all. Remember these three things: The cornerstone of the NA program is total abstinence. There is no substitute for surrender. Recovery is a complete change of everything we do, everything we think. I was in a halfway house many years ago and on every wall, in every direction you could look, there was a sign that read, ""WHY ARE YOU HERE?"". Until I knew the answer I was full of doubt/contradiction. Once I accepted my being an addict I never had to ask myself that question again. You may benefit from looking at the ultra old-school steps..... from the 1940's before NA actually became what it is to day.... Here they are, they're kinda neat I think... In the lead up to forming NA as we know it today, the very first meetings were actually held with the help of The Salvation Army. Early NA pioneers adapted the SA's 7-steps, adding to them to create the 13-steps. I suspect this was to help differentiate NA from the existing AA meetings. Here's Greg sharing the 13 steps- Original 13 steps- listen to 10:10  _HYPERLINK_ 13 STEPS OF NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS 01 Admit the use of narcotics made my life more tolerable, but the drug had become an undesirable power over my life. 02 Came to realize that to face life without drugs I must develop an inner strength. 03 Made a decision to face the suffering of withdrawal. 04 Learned to accept my fears without drugs. 05 Find someone who has progressed this far & is able to assist me. 06 Admit to him the nature & depth of my addiction. 07 Realize the seriousness of my shortcomings as I know them & accept responsibility for facing them. 08 Admit before a group of N.A. members these same shortcomings & explain how I am trying to overcome them. 09 List, for my own understanding, all the persons I have hurt. 10 Take a daily inventory of my actions & admit to myself those which are contrary to good conscience. 11 Realize that to maintain freedom from drugs I must share with others the experience from which I have benefited. 12 Determine a purpose in my life & try with all the spiritual & physical power within me to move towards this fulfillment. 13 GOD HELP ME !

jr5komi,"NA, AA, and even most recovery related housing facilities here in Illinois are abstinence only. I am a recovering addict who is on a long-term treatment plan involving suboxone and now medical Marijuana. When I was coming out of treatment, I spent weeks trying to find a sober living facility that would let me pay the astronomical fees to stay there. I'd spiraled into a decade of homelessness along with destroying my body , mind, and soul. After I'd exhausted every resource, which honestly didn't tall that long, I was forced to stay in a vacant building with the same people, in the same place and while they all did the same things. Luckily for me, I kept advocating for myself and managed to jam myself into the opening left when another patient flaked. Even after spending months working to get sober, weeks begging for a bed and enduring unending sessions while watching people use I was still subjected to many excess rules and restrictions that made it quite difficult to simply live, as well as making me the target of constant ridicule from housemates and ""staff"" members. I had to tread lightly when I would share at meetings, too, because I would make myself a target. My area being severely limited in the number of meetings being offered means myself and many others have no choice but attend AA, where saying "" hi I'm Zeke and I'm an addict "" was often great way to make enemies. Even in NA, I would be treated poorly by my fellows because I am cheating, or simply not sober by some peoples standards. I myself have studied and questioned enough to know that addiction is not something that can be cured, only treated. I know that 15 years of substance abuse can mean 30 years of recovery and that every patients treatment plan looks different. That is why I reserve judgment and focus on healing for myself as well as others. I also understand that most people are weak and selfish even when they are trying to help someone else. I believe that is why ,as a rule many people are judgmental about medicine assisted recovery and why even after all this time anonymity is such a focus in recovery despite most Americans being addicts enslaved by sex, drugs, money, etc....",1688825543.0

jr4tgnm,No. Talk with your sponsor. I’ve recently relapsed (alcohol) .. however I got clean from Meth in 2005. I’ve sponsored many people from then to now. And carried them through the steps. One things I found as a sponsor is that we ALL have a different path. We’re all brought to a place where a controlled substance may help us. From withdrawals to prescription from surgery to manage our pain. I cringe when I here “old timers” talk about not needing pain meds after a major surgery. Be upfront and honest with your doctor and sponsor. Talk and be honest in the meetings and with your support group. A relapse is decided by you and your sponsor agree it’s a relapse. But be sure that it’s you making that decision. Take care of yourself as best you can and keep honesty in the foremost. We all have different paths my friend. Many of the people I sponsored started with Suboxone .. taking pain meds after surgery (which got them high).

jr4afm6,"NA has a MAT IP in the works and it’s not exactly a secret that group autonomy has largely stopped preventing people on MAT for sharing and doing different levels of service. Area and region and H&I aren’t there but if we didn’t let addicts on MAT share or serve, we’d be looking at about a third of the rooms being furniture. It’s become a much more welcoming environment for people on MAT as it should be, as it should always have been. It’s still a mess but it’s getting better. What they won’t ever do is change “clean” in regards to the program’s official definition at large for MAT. Because it’s a medication being used specifically to treat addiction, it runs into a conflict with the steps and literature at its floor - A twelve step program treats addiction with a higher power, the twelve steps, trusting God, cleaning house, helping others, all that jazz. Step Two presents the main dilemma as it’s “a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.” Further in 3 as far as “and lives” “to the care of”. If a person is using MAT to treat addiction, the belief is that it runs counter to the program presenting a spiritual solution based in abstinence from mind altering mood altering substances over a chemical one - The trust fall into the care of a God concept and the twelve steps isn’t there if a person is still addressing their addiction with substances rather than faith. Working the steps is then gatekept by some because the direction of the literature says the first thing we have to do to work them is no longer have our minds clouded by etc etc etc and be abstinent as defined by the program. This debate was had at great length during the methadone boom and again during the most recent opiate epidemics and it kept coming back to the same points of contention within the steps. The closest thing we have to official clarification is the MAT story in the Basic Text, the bulletins on MAT from NAWS and the IP for professionals: _HYPERLINK_ “As we stated previously, NA has no opinion on the practices of any organizations or practitioners outside NA. However, within the context of NA and its meetings, we have generally accepted principles, and one is that NA is a program of complete abstinence. By definition, medically assisted therapy indicates that medication is being given to people to treat addiction. In NA, addiction is treated by abstinence and through application of the spiritual principles contained in the Twelve Steps of Narcotics Anonymous.” “Tradition Ten restricts NA, as a fellowship, from stating opinions on outside issues. However, it places no such restriction on the individual member.” (It Works, “Tradition Ten”) Our hope is that those who receive medication to treat addiction will come to meetings and listen to people who are recovering. Through listening and through asking questions before and after meetings, attendees may gain a better understanding of NA and what it has to offer. NA offers a community and a lifestyle that support staying clean, and NA may be compatible for addicts on medically assisted protocols if they have a desire to become clean one day. We understand that addicts whose path is medically assisted treatment may hear many messages in NA meetings. Some NA meetings make no distinction as to whether those receiving medication to treat addiction may share in a meeting, while other NA meetings limit the participation of those who are taking this type of medication. Each group is free to make its own decision on recovery meeting participation and involvement in group services for those receiving medication assistance for drug addiction.” While the program on paper is unlikely to ever recognize MAT as “NA Approved” clean, the stigma is finally dissipating to some degree and people are treating addicts on MAT the way they should be treated. Group autonomy isn’t being weaponized against MAT anymore and is instead making for more inclusive meetings and even some dedicated meetings like you mentioned. Do I personally believe the program is coming correct in regards to MAT? No. Do I personally believe people on MAT are clean? Yes. Would I take someone on MAT through the steps? It would be an honor and a privilege. Is it in the top three things I dislike the most about my program? Sure is. Will I do everything in my very small grain of sand power to be the change I want to see with MAT in regards to accepting and helping those within the program? Absolutely. Am I expecting them to ever call MAT clean? Unfortunately not, not in my lifetime. Regardless of what they define as abstinence, I’m sick of burying people and I think most of the people in the rooms are as well - If it keeps a person out of the ground, I don’t really care what NA has to say about it.",1688792729.0

jr322tm,That's strange every addicts best friend is their drug dealer. Or was it cocaine is your friend. And in reality you have no friends. Your drug dealer is a salesman he makes money by selling drugs. Friendly sociable people make more sales by pretending to be your friend so how can you turn your friend down when he's wanting to sell you drugs. Any person who's causing you to relapse must be removed from your life. Whoever you surround yourself with you will become. Seek out new activities to introduce you to new people that could potentially become your friends. Make sure they will help support your sobriety. Stop having negative thoughts about yourself and calling yourself names. This is a sure way to make yourself miserable and then that causing a relapse. Perfectionism is an All or nothing proposition. When you approach things in life there will be times that you fail but how you go about it can dictate how your life goes. Nobody is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. Mistakes are part of learning and growing. As long as you tried your best you should be happy with the result you got. You shouldn't call yourself names and belittle yourself it does nothing useful. You should look at the situation and understand it. In hindsight it is easy to see what you could have done but this information wasn't revealed quite yet. So at that time there was no way for you to know. Don't beat yourself up.

Just as we wouldn’t suggest that an insulin-dependent diabetic addict stop taking their insulin, we don’t tell mentally ill addicts to stop taking their prescribed medication. We leave medical issues up to doctors. As NA members, our primary purpose is to carry the message of recovery to the addict who still suffers, not to give medical advice. Responsibility rests with the member to be honest about their condition with informed healthcare professionals, and to evaluate their treatment and medication options. An aspect of addiction is the compulsive misuse and abuse of drugs, often at the expense of our physical and mental health. In recovery, we learn to be responsible for ourselves. For some addicts, this may mean seeking mental health treatment and taking medication as prescribed.” _HYPERLINK_ NA IP - Mental Health in Recovery “Many of us have heard, either individually or in meetings, that members taking medication are not clean.

It is possible to die from benzo withdrawal but you only abused for such a short time it seems unlikely depending if you combined with alcohol or other substances.I would still taper down safely just in case it won't take long. I abused Xanax XR's for 3-4 years with cocaine and a bit of alcohol and I went through the worst withdrawal for 3 years straight and I'm glad I'm not as bad as I once was but I still wake up dizzy and with panic attacks 3 years later I just got used to take a bite a piece off a Xanax and go on about my day.

jr1qipf,"I think that examining our past relationships before we think of entering a new one is key. I suggest making a kind of pro and con list. On one side list all of the positive attributes you want a partner to have. On the other side, list all of the negative attribute you don’t want your partner to have. Then set it aside for a few days. Come back to it and add whatever comes to mind. When you feel like your list is as complete as you can get it (for now), go back over it and rank the importance of each item on both sides. The negative side rank is the things you least want have a higher rank. Put it down for a while again and come back. Now look at the list and decide which things are a “must have” and a “can’t have”. These are your “deal breakers”. This will help you clarify what kind of relationship you want to have. The challenge once you start dating is that often the deal breakers appear in their milder forms. It’s important to pay attention and note these things to yourself so you can be aware if they grow into the deal breaker. Sex and beauty also confuse the issue. Sex early in a relationship creates an artificial emotional attachment, so It’s easy to see a deal breaker and rationalize it away because “the sex is so good”, or you “feel close” to this person, or you’ve “invested too much time” in the relationship. I fell into this trap at 5 years and barely escaped. Nobody’s perfect, but if you go through with this process you’ll know when you’re making a bad choice AND WHY. Good luck friend!",1688750478.0
jr1j90g,"This is unfortunately a hard truth I’ve learned in sobriety, we’re always just a second away from a relapse no matter how much clean time we have. One of my friends who helped me a lot when I was just getting sober and coming to terms with all my horrible choices, she had 10 years, and I found out a couple weeks ago that she relapsed and has gone back out and stayed out. When I talked to her and asked if she wanted to quit she point blank said no. I knew this happened a lot, but I didn’t expect to be so affected by it. I understand it but my heart still hurts, because like everyone else standing by and watching the addict destroy themselves, I am powerless to help them. I can support them in their recovery but I cannot be responsible for it, nor for their decision to stay in active addiction. It’s the nature of the beast with this.",1688747675.0

We drank together and smoked together. She wasn't in the addiction with me and refrained from doing those activities when we were together. Best friend was mad when I moved out. I left her with a lot of shit and thankfully, her mom moved in to help her. But best friend DID want me clean and sober which your friend doesn't seem to care much about...which makes her not a great friend. Set boundaries. Your best friend is sick and hasn't hit her rock bottom yet. You can be a listening ear but you do not have to be in the thick of it. And telling her all of this, is the way to go about it.

After speaking with her today, she is for in the throes of relapse. She’s gone through the 9 stages of relapse already. Her admission of life and her current behavior have really added up to the 9 stages she didn’t acknowledge.

jqu5lzq,It was explained to me that no one would agree to the program if they had to stop all psychoactive substances. Statistically the ongoing nicotine use disorder increases the persons chance of relapse because the brains dopamine receptors never find true equilibrium. I spent most of my life as a person trapped in nicotine use disorder. What I learned is that nicotine actually impacts the brains reward system and prevents the natural break down of dopamine in the body by inhibiting the absorption process. Over time the brain learns to only operate at a surplus. That is why quitting is so hard and the social norm of the ongoing use doesn't help. I personally found my local state program helpful this the national program. _HYPERLINK_,1688608738.0

jqtzpkt,"I've got 8ish years of sobriety (I don't count days) and do feel that way at times. I'd attribute it mostly to bad social anxiety and untreated ADHD. I'll find something that interests me and then let it drop. On paper, I'm doing well I have a steady job, own a home, have a great nuclear family, etc. But it is still a struggle to force myself out of the house sometimes. It's definitely worse during certain parts of the year - I absolutely loathe hot weather and the summer, so I really have to force myself out of the house during this time of year. I do much better in the winter when it's under 50°F/10°C. That said, it has slowly gotten better over the years. Trying to make routines helps me. I started with something small - a skincare routine - and worked my way up to having a day for grocery shopping, a day for eating out/getting coffee at a café, etc. I live in a beautiful state, so I try to explore the parks and trails around me when it's not miserably hot. I bought a good pair of binoculars and downloaded the Merlin app for birdwatching - birdwatching gets me out of the house and is an independent enough activity that I'll still likely interact with a few folks wherever I'm watching but won't feel the pressure of a crowd or event. I've gotten used to going out enough now that I've started to go to concerts again when I have the interest/funds (though I don't listen to many of the big artists like Taylor Swift, I don't think I could handle that kind of crowd). Basically, I started small and worked my way up to bigger crowds/activities. It's also worth talking to a psychologist about this or even a psychiatrist if you think you'd benefit from meds. I did a CBT IOP a year or two into recovery and it was so helpful in reducing my propensity to ruminate and catastrophize, which has certainly helped my social anxiety (though it's definitely still there - just not as bad!).

jqsezxx,"I feel you on this! I'm about 9 months into sobriety, really leveling out, but I do notice how I flip a switch into that addictive mindset and it's always around nicotine, sugar, and caffeine. All three of these, especially the sugar and Nic I use to comfort myself with depression, anxiety, and uncomfortable emotions, but ironically after the high they always make me feel worse. Haaa The good news is that being in a 12 step program I'm familiar with the frame work needed to disempower some of this shit, and slowly but surely I'm making progress with all these. Here's what's worked for me: With the nicotine I got to a rock bottom type of place with it. It was deeply bothering me that I was so dependent. It was causing physical pain (lungs, headaches, stomach), obsessive thinking, and lack of appetite, which just amplified the feedback loop of ""oh I feel like shit I need something."" I had my first big deadline in sobriety and had just quit smoking weed around that time. I saw how much power the obsession had on me and I knew it was keeping me in a heightened state. I started tapering, got connected with a free state sponsored quit line service and picked a date to stop buying packs. The Quitline helped a lot bc they got me free Nic mints and gave me 7 free \~20 minute calls with a counselor to discuss my history and plan for quitting. I just really took advantage of this window of time where I wanted it. Felt soooo good to get through the withdrawals. They told me on the Quitline it takes 7 minutes to get through a craving and figure out how to distract yourself for that amount of time. I occasionally smoke a cig, occasionally vape. But I don't mind that right now bc I'm early in sobriety and just not buying packs any more getting out of the intense dependence feels right for me. Progress not perfection on that. With the cigs, go easy on yourself. Lots of people in the 12 step fellowship I'm a part of say get through your first year dealing with DOC recovery. Part of that is bc those people also said they needed the 12 steps just to quit tobacco. It was way harder for them because of the cravings and accessibility. Something they needed to look at on its own. Caffeine, I gave myself a time of day and number of cups cut off. One in the morning and one in the afternoon. Even if I felt tired and like total shit. Now I'm adjusted to a morning cup and it's pretty easy. I also started making myself drink 2 L of water a day around that time. I noticed how much better I felt from drinking my water and didn't crave the caffeine as much as I thought I did. The sugar....It's that fucking obsessive thinking and I'll just binge eat. But it makes me feel like fucking shit after. I get all weird, ashamed, and secretive of it too. Trying to look at my relationship to food...am I eating bc I'm hungry or bc my obsessive addiction brain is turning on. Usually the latter. So I try to be really intentional about being nutrition meal centered. And honestly like make myself write down goals and just keep tabs on how much sugar Im eating bc it goes off the deep end. Started going to the gym which helps so much with issues around mood and appetite. The empowerment to make this progress comes from really trying to do 12 step work and dismantling the hold of my addictive brain.

jqrlfhl,"Loneliness. That’s the one thing drugs and alcohol can’t fix. In fact, it eventually makes it worse. At first, it numbs it… makes being alone OK. Alone became my preference. Being alone, there’s no “crazy” stories of my antics… less shame and regret, no hurt or disappointed people to look at, no folks throwing out my stuff or lecturing me on what I’m doing to myself. But the weight of the loneliness is more than the high of the substance can bear. Over time, it starts to creep in. Then there’s the inappropriate phone calls and text messages, crying on the floor after watching a romantic comedy, being forced to go outside for whatever reason, and watching with envy all the normal folks with their “happy” lives… feeling unworthy, unloved and unredeemable. Substances made me feel good, too good actually… but ultimately they only allowed me to connect to myself. Substances drove a rusted wedge in between me and any healthy relationship. Anyone who actually cared about me eventually was unable to watch the spiral of self destruction. Near the end, it was only me and the substance. Me; a quaking, shivering shell of a human… and the substance; a mere flicker of joy in the infinite maw of a deep yearning for more. And finally… the high itself withered and began to fade. My own brain chemistry and biological functions betrayed me. Faltering through a massive tolerance to the substance and the damage done to my cells and organs. The high itself receded like the sea at low tide… And then, left on the shore, I was truly Alone. And that, is the bitter morass, the quicksand that stretches in all directions. When the very thing that impelled me to drive everyone away to be able to keep, finally stepped to the side, and I could not help but see the vast, gray wasteland before me. The broken wreckage of my dreams, the destroyed relationships, the corpses of hope and a future that contained any joy… and always the storm of the consequences brewing and growing ever closer. But… also a path I had perhaps been unwilling to see or consider, away from that familiar shore of suffering and desire. And then I only have a choice to make. Remain or go.",1688570502.0
jqrg7aq,"So have a think about what factors would help you with sobriety. If you became mentally unwell, would you be more likely to drink? What about if you were on a medication to prevent that? If you have a condition that causes mania / psychosis, you probably need to be on a medication to prevent further episodes. In my experience working with people with both mental health conditions and addictions, keeping yourself mentally well is really important in maintaining your sobriety. Most mental health medications will not make you more likely to relapse (although Aripiprazole and benzodiazepines/stimulants/medications with abuse potential may be best avoided). The bottom line is to talk to your psychiatrist about your concerns. Tell them you want to avoid any medication that will increase the chances of relapse. They'll know which to avoid. As for AA, it's not really their business what medication you may or may not be taking for your mental health, don't feel pressured to divulge your entire medical history to anyone, there's a reason that stuff is confidential.

But I used to smoke weed prior to other things, and have resorted back to weed now, and I am right back up there with the amount I consume as I have ever been. I think my turning to weed (in the first place and again recently) is because it brings a sort of familiarity, which brings a kind of comfort, rather than choosing to try something unfamiliar and face the possibility of failing. I’ve realized that people can’t be depended on, and now I have to depend on me to be the person I need. No one is going to cheer me on. No one is going to be there pushing me everyday. I have to push. I have to reparent myself and learn to be the cheerleader that I need right now. I used to be that person, but I lost myself along the road of life. I remind myself that change will take time, and that’s the hardest part - knowing that things need to change, wanting the changes to happen immediately, and being gentle with myself when I do slip. I have to also remind myself that right now, here in this moment, I am safe. Only I can chose what I do next, so chose something. My favourite thing is to be physically active. It gives me an outlet for my energy, keeps my mind focused (and gives me time to think without distractions). This winter was really bad for me as I share a home and don’t like to feel disruptive, so I kept it to a minimum. Exercise is one thing that I have control over, so I’m starting to look at it as something that I can turn to whenever I don’t know what else to do.

I have no problem with almost any opinions in recovery, it is the arrogance of these people to assert they are right and everyone else is wrong, that irritates me AND IT SHOULD, that is normal, they are doing something that needs speaking out against and it is dangerous for alcoholics to even go there, so many cannot handle it and their egos inflate to ridiculous levels and they really believe they are experts and simply because of their confidence people follow them around and when these people go down they take a bunch with them, this is NOT the AA way!",1688388601.0

jqeg66y,"I have been off of prescription pain killers for over a year now. I’m in a MAT program right now and currently stable on 90mg of methadone. The process has been difficult, especially since I work full time and have children. My husband has been my biggest supporter and has stood by my side through this whole process. There are times however, he wishes I would just jump off the methadone (which I know is very dangerous for me to do), but overall he continued to support my recovery and has always taken care of me throughout this process. He helped me through my initial detox when I went from the pills to suboxone and when I had to do the same to get on the methadone (I had severe reactions to the sub and program I was going though didn’t prescribe the subs without naloxone so I switch to methadone). I think what has been beneficial in my case is that is also suffered from substance abuse and was using much heavier drugs in combination with each other. He stopped cold turkey so he understand the misery and pain that comes with withdrawal. But also we are very open with each other and keep our communication open and honest as well as frequent with each other. When I’m feeling low, he talks me through it and when he starts to be pushy and say “I wish you did it my way,” I remind him that we are different people and that kind of talk is not helpful and it’s hurtful. He typically understands and redirects himself. Communication is key in any relationship. But especially for us in recovery. I know it can be difficult for our partners to want to listen to us or even trust us because our behavior in the past was more than likely to be sneaky and untrustworthy. And honestly, it took months for my husband to have trust in me again. What really helped that was being more honest and open about my feelings, what scared me and how I would to want hear his opinions on things with him doing the same for me. I also stopped engaging in a lot of things that made him suspicious and changed my whole routine around so I could show him I was serious about changing my life and becoming a better person. Maybe try letting him know you would like to work on building your level of communication so you don’t feel scared or like you have to hide your feelings. Let them know that you do care and want to make the relationship work and by doing so, you want to ensure that you both can communicate your wants, needs and expectations.

It eventually fades, especially when I identified the primary emotion underneath the anger, which was fear. I now work to address those fears. Tackling the anger head on didn’t work for me, and neither did pushing it down. I had to analyze it to get to its roots. I had the help of a sponsor and a therapist while doing this, and I still use them as a part of my recovery.

jqcxnvl,"First: congrats on sobriety and way to go, for real. Getting sober is hard af. How long have you been sober? Forgive me, and disregard if this doesn't apply, but in early sobriety (the first year at least) one of the hardest things for me and many others is that you feel your feelings, and definitely more so for those of us with trauma. The memories, pain, anger, and even just discomfort that we used to drink and use to block out are just there. It's really hard and super fucking uncomfortable to experience it all unfiltered, with out a way to escape or block it out. It's incredibly difficult not to fixate on emotions and intrusive memory, and ruminate. Forgive me for just dumping here, but I promise it can be helpful: from tons of therapy around trauma, what I've been taught (and found to be true) is that when we try to block out or push down negative feelings, effectively it's like holding it all behind a dam, without letting any pressure out. If you hold it back and hold it back, eventually it will burst, and be more intense than it was before, if that makes sense. The thing I was taught to do is to just allow the feelings when you have them. I can't fixate and stay stuck on them, or allow them to consume me, but in a kind of detached, observant way, I acknowledge the feeling, and know it will pass. I let emotion happen and feel whatever it is that needs to be felt: I cry in anger or sadness about what happened, ways I was hurt, things that were done that were just patently not okay or right or fair... I scream in pillows, or hit them. One therapist taught me it was okay to throw things at a wall, when it was appropriate (that weren't fragile or would cause damage to the wall, but still felt gratifying). Writing it all out helps sometimes. Labeling the emotions in a nonjudgmental way can be helpful, like ""oh, that's anger, that's fear, that's shame"". I say nonjudgmental because we don't have control over emotions we feel, just our reactions to them. It doesn't help me to be mad that I'm still angry or afraid about stuff I feel like I should be ""over', it doesn't help me to call myself stupid or mad at myself when I'm anxious, or feel guilty about old actions. And then after feeling an emotion, allowing it to exist and sitting with it in all of its intense discomfort, as opposed to trying to suppress or fixate on it, it passes. This absolutely applies later in sobriety too. Also, with more practice and more time allowing emotions to happen, it gets easier and at least a little less uncomfortable. I think emotional sobriety is a real thing, for sure. When I'm not dealing with my emotions well, or tending to my mental health, I am 100% as toxic and angry, as problematic to myself and others as I was in active addiction (kind of there now, but working on it). There's also no shame in seeking mental health care, and it's often necessary to process trauma. Also, please don't minimize what you've been through. I do it to myself, too. But, whatever each person has been through that was traumatizing to them was very real and damaging to them, it's not less valid than anyone else's experiences. Just because someone else has been through worse doesn't negate or invalidate anyone else's trauma or lived experiences. Again, I'm sorry if that was too much or too in-depth, I'm just trying to share what I've learned and hope maybe my experiences the little bits of knowledge I've been taught can maybe help someone else.",1688285781.0

He has definitely shown me support and love in the ways you've mentioned. This is a great point. I think he definitely has put boundaries up because I've been relapsing a lot in the past few months after having had been able to stay sober for long periods of time before. Part of this is due to us moving back home again and me being around old friends, old spots that trigger cravings for me. And trying to find new support systems again, new meetings, etc. I've suggested AlAnon for him but he doesn't want to go because he doesn't see why he should have to (I never told him he has to but just said it might help him) but I think it's also because he grew up with an alcoholic parent and it's hard to be in those environments without reliving his past trauma. This is also why I feel so guilty and I'm sure that sounds contradicting to what I first wrote but it's one of the main reasons I've been considering not marrying him because I am scared that I haven't been able to stay sober recently and I don't want him to keep having to live in a household with substance use disorder.

jqbq5wq,"Partner of an ex-alcoholic here. I know that I'm generally bias towards partners and have never experienced addiction, so take what I say with a grain of salt. I promise that nothing I say is meant to be hurtful, only because you asked & seemed like you wanted a sincere answer... The short, tough love answer is the majority of the work falls on you unfortunately. You have the substance use disorder and you are the one that is being dishonest with your partner. Your partner fills the roll of supporting (wihout enabling) you through recovery. And both of you are responsible for having good, open communication with each other. I do absolutely understand the desire of wanting the love and comfort of your loved one, and I have to imagine that it incredibly difficult to not only carry your own burden/shame of relapsing, but also all the negative emotions of disppointing your partner. Addiction is a terrible disease and I really do believe that that it is a challenging journey to overcome. I do NOT believe you're being emotionally manipulative by wanting the comfort of your fiance. It is perfectly human to want comfort and encouragement when things get rough. You also are not letting your fiance down by failing to stay sober. However, I encourage you to first consider if your fiance has been supporting you throughout your entire journey in other ways, such as taking on extra house chores, through tough love, reminding you of appointments you'd forgotten, staying up to listen despite having a tough day, etc. Just because he isn't trying to comfort you about relapsing doesn't mean he isn't being supportive. Second, I would encourage you to consider that addiction is a family disease, having broader impacts than just on the person struggling with addiction. Your fiance is likely also struggling with the impacts of addiction & relapse, just differently. It is possible that he's put up boundaries to help protect his mental health and prevent enabling because it is extremely easy for relationships to become unhealthy & codependent when dealing with addiction. Though it may not feel like he cares, I would not be surprised if he's doing what he's doing because he cares for you deeply. ( r/AlAnon talks a bit more about it if you want more info) Some questions to consider: When you relapse and want to lean on him, who does he lean on? Have the two of you ever discussed his feelings about addiction/relapses (I don't mean about him not wanting you to lie-- I mean how does it make him feel? Scared? Sad? Isolated? Overwhelmed?). What steps have you taken to stop relapsing? If AA isn't working, have you considered psychology/counselling options? Or spoken to others in recovery for things that worked to prevent them from relapsing? (Note: All rhetorical). >He got very upset and didn't want to listen to me about why it happened or how. Whether or not addiction is a factor in a relationship, accountability is really important for any relationship. At the end of the day, does it really matter why or how it happened? The fact is that it did happen after you had committed to quitting. From a partner perspective, it feels like an excuse for someone's actions & not taking accountability. I could be wrong, but based solely on what's written, it sounds like he does have an understanding of addiction and it doesn't sound like he's expecting you to be magically cured or that you're a bed person--rather he wants you to be accountable for lying to him and isn't accepting addiction as an excuse for lying. If it were my partner, I would much prefer my partner to say ""Look, I effed up majorly and I broke your trust as a result.

It really sucks at times, and I don't think anyone denies that. Understanding why you relapsed is extremely important, but should be worked through with a trained professional, not your partner. If you're struggling to communicate, I'd strongly recommend going to a couples counsellor that has experience with addiction. Addiction can be a very sensitive topic for both partners, and for me, being able to speak freely and discuss relationship expectations with someone there to help us navigate what's reasonable and what wasn't was so helpful for us navigating a difficult situation that we didn't have a guidebook on.

Whether you fess up or not, you still lied to him. This is justification and I get it because I did it for years. You didn’t relapse because you had an argument. You didn’t relapse because of bi polar. You relapse because you haven’t done enough work on self and finding new coping strategies (I have bi polar and BPD, I get the struggle, please reach out to your medical provider for support with this) Why should he comfort you when you constantly relapse and lie to him? That isn’t his job. I wouldn’t respect him if he did either because the more comfortable it is for us to do it, the more we will. I have also been with an addict whilst not using and let me tell you, it’s the lying that’s the worst part, whether you admit it or not. It’s gaslighting and it’s abuse, whether intentional or not, and it makes people stressed and ill.

Regardless, it looks like you are overthinking it and it is causing you to stress out. Here are my suggestions. Go to ANY meeting in the area that you can find that's drug-related. AA, NA, CA, HA -the underlying message is the same with all of them. AA normally has the most meetings so I'd start there even if Alcohol isn't your drug of choice. Download the AA meeting guide app on your phone or access it here: _HYPERLINK_ _HYPERLINK_ it will show you all the meetings in your area and beyond. I guarantee you there are more than you think there are. You can also consider trying out Zoom meetings - they will actually work better than you think and if you are socially awkward, people sometimes hang out afterward in zoom and just chat for a bit, which is less pressure than a normal in-person setting. In regards to getting a sponsor- don't make it a big deal. Go to a meeting, raise your hand, and say I need help, I want to do the steps, and I need a sponsor. Don't overthink it, just let somebody else tell you what to do for a while. If you don't like that person or it isn't working out, drop them and get another one. Further - A sponsor's main role is to guide you through the steps, not be a therapist On that note, consider getting a therapist or enrolling in group therapy, like an IOP. I know that's a lot of information - but that just shows you that the help is out there if you are willing to take it!

Continue their recovery process by having their children live with them. That way they can not only progress in recovery but they will be given more support with things like how to write a résumé, how to search for a job, parenting classes, anger management classes etc. We will give them legal services for dealing with child protective services or fathers of their children with custody cases etc.. We want to have an in-house child care that will be staffed with volunteers from the house. We will have women-only meetings that focus on recovery and motherhood. We had our first fundraiser in May and hope to have the facility up and running within two years. We feel this type of facility would plug the gap between leaving the protected atmosphere of a halfway house and just going right out into life. We feel mothers with children have a greater need for support before they can stand on their own 2 feet. The question in this thread has made me think about the need for women to have babysitters even before they get to our facility so they can kickstart their recovery through a halfway house.

jq233m9,"I had a similar situation. However at that age I was not willing to accept treatment and I think other approaches, for me turning to spirituality (in whatever form makes sense to someone, I mean AA even prescribes this) has been helpful to reduce my usage over a decade later though I am not entirely sober. If spirituality isn't relatable, I suggest SMART Recovery, as it is the most effective for secular-minded people. SMART is somewhat available in some rehabs, but even most that offer it don't consider it a standard treatment and it is given as an adjunct to mandatory 12 steps. There have been studies which suggest combining both SMART and 12 steps is less effective than either modality by itself, and I think this is due to the emphasis on spirituality, which essentially results in a very different way of framing one's self concept (either in relation to a ""higher power"" in whatever form that may be whether or not accurately considered in context of a ""legitimate"" spiritual practice, or otherwise in relation to rational emotive behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy which have the benefit of being empirically validated yet result and stem from an entirely different epistemological and ontological basis than spiritual approaches to addictive recovery). There is not really a right or wrong way to approach this, it's whatever works, even if that means a ""harm reduction"" approach until sobriety seems possible. I hope you do find a rehab that will help, however most people tend to recover on their own or drastically reduce their usage as they get older. If your son's safety is unquestionably at danger as a result of his usage presently, maybe rehab is the best option.

Your intentions are good, but he’s gonna get picked on at school for it (because let’s be honest, teenagers can be cruel) which will make him keep that kinda stuff secret, which is a bad habit to get into.

His sobriety coming out of treatment is his shot at having a normal life and he may not necessarily benefit from sober living as much at this age and lifestyle.

Good luck and please update us, I’m excited that he has another shot at life and you have really set him up for success by getting him into treatment and confronting his behaviors at all.

It's probably extremely difficult to determine if your son is an alcoholic that young, though you can see plenty of ""I always knew"" anecdotes for people's confirmation biases. Rehab is unlikely to help your son if he does not really care to quit. If that is the case, it's probably best to just kinda ""give up"" on trying to control his substance abuse as it will probably backfire resulting in increased usage, this is very common among addicts or otherwise non-addicted drug users when forced with outside intervention that one doesn't want in a facility with freedoms restricted while you are often treated condescendingly or worse by staff, at least that's how state funded rehabs tend to ""work."" And it's just weed, vape, alcohol?? If he was severely bad off in heroin or ruined his life over a course of drinking or has been drinking for years hardcore, I would say rehab would be sensible. But it sounds like your son was just experimenting with extremely common and not often deemed as ""hard drugs,"" it's fairly common these days, I would stop listening to ""experts"" on this subject because I probably know more experts that challenge experts you think you know. Read Dr. Carl Hart, for instance, or find his lectures on YouTube, you would infer that while he is not an expert on addiction per se his empirical findings on drug usage have contradicted long-held assumptions about how drugs and also addiction work, which at the very least provides reason for caution against hastily pushing your son off into rehab.

You are going to need more and more to try to get that euphoric feeling, and the duration of that euphoria is going to be shorter and shorter. And you will chase that feeling. I was on it for a legitimate pain issue, I got it filled every month, I didn't get it from multiple doctors or anything, I didn't ever try to get it filled early. But I have abused the shit out of it. And when I would first get it filled, I'd take a whole ton of them. And then I would have to taper down to get through the rest of the month, because that withdrawal punishes you so quickly. And my life became being able to have that before feeling for maybe a couple of hours and then just taking more and more trying to get it to come back but it wouldn't come back. I was prescribed 400 mg a day. And yes you did not misread that, 400mg. I was on it for so long that I could take 1,000 mg at once. And that's enough to kill three grown men. And I am a 150 lb woman. Tolerance is a thing. But most of the time was just trying to take enough so that I felt well. Enough to stave off the withdrawal. I can't even imagine if I were getting it illegally, how much it would cost to go at the rate I was going at. But because it didn't really work, I also used alcohol. It's truly amazing that I didn't die permanently. I almost did several times. And one time I succeeded but was brought back. I thought I was functional. I worked, I took care of myself, I did the things I had to do. And I was utterly miserable. I hated myself. I was angry every morning I woke up. For many years. I was ""functional"". Until I wasn't.

jpxx02v,"At least, you know now. Everybody is different. Everyone needs to find their own boundaries/triggers and then be brutally honest with themselves about them. Many doctors will prescribe you anything these days and most are surprisingly clueless when it comes to treating people with addiction (this is even true with a lot of ""addiction specialists""). Not that it's totally their fault - addiction is very complex, extremely understudied, and impossible to fully understand if you've never experienced it. People use drugs for a very wide variety of reasons. Each individual's response to a certain prescription and/or treatment can vary greatly. What may help one person could hurt another (hell, the same person using the same treatment could have totally opposite effects depending on when along their journey to sobriety it is administered ). At the end of the day, nobody knows more about you than yourself and nobody can be a greater advocate for you than yourself. To maximize your chances of success, you need to be responsible for everything that goes into your body (even if some doctor said it's ok), do your own research, be honest with yourself about its potential benefits/risks, have the self-discipline to say no, and most importantly, catch any mistakes you make quickly and learn from them. I've been ""Cali sober"" for 9 years (my first time hearing the term despite being in the program for 15 years and living in California, lol). Although, I guess it makes sense. A big chunk of my NA friends out here have been sober from opiates for a while but still drink/smoke weed from time to time. But I've also known a few people who thought they could successfully drink/smoke on the side and had to find out the hard way that they could not. By the time I was finally getting off opiates for good, I already knew with a high degree of certainty that I responded to alcohol and weed very differently than I did with opiates. Even still, I didn't want to take any risks and for my first 2.5 years, I was sober from everything (except suboxone). I had planned to be totally sober for just a year at first but that was so easy I decided to do another. I knew I likely didn't have issues because, with alcohol, I could have a 6-pack in my fridge for years without touching/thinking about it. With weed, I could go from smoking all day/every day to a family vacation for 2-weeks and not even think about smoking/getting weed once. With opiates though, things were drastically different. I couldn't have them near me without immediately taking them and once I started, that was pretty much all I did or thought about until I ran out of money and my life was in shambles. For example, during my addiction, I was lucky enough to go down to Hawaii and stay in an incredible beach house with a bunch of buddies and beautiful/fun women for a week and a half of partying, surfing, hiking, etc. I only had enough opiates for the first 4 days then I had to shift over to subs. After those first 4 days, all I could think about was what excuse I was going to use to fly home early. One night I was sitting out on my bedroom's deck searching for earlier flights back home on my laptop, I remember hearing the waves crashing on the beach, looking up, and seeing how stunningly clear and beautiful all the stars were over the dark ocean. It hit me... I was staring off into the abyss from this ridiculous mansion on the edge of a tiny island in the center of the Pacific Ocean. The deck opened up into this fancy-ass bedroom behind me where a really cool girl that I liked was passed out in my bed - yet the only thing I could think of, or wanted to do, was be back in my tiny, shitty-ass studio apartment so I could use in peace, all by myself. It was pathetic. I remember thinking how irrational and depressing that reality was. Here I was in a situation most people only dream of but I wasn't able to fully enjoy it and I would have thrown it all away in a second just to be able to use. Haven't thought of that moment for a while but looking back, it's crazy how metaphoric that situation was to addiction as a whole. Sorry, I went on a tangent there. My point is, after a few years of opiate addiction it became very obvious to me that I had a different relationship with it than I did with any other substance. If cravings for a certain substance are so strong that it causes you to do very irrational things or choose it over things you love. Your life will most likely be a lot better without it. Total abstinence is the safest for most people and a great place to start. You can always re-assess later. I will often go totally sober for 3 months to a year just to prove to myself that I can. Addiction ""solutions"" are not one size fits all. Everybody needs to find the solution that fits best for themselves but it's important to know the difference between wanting to be able to smoke weed on the side and knowing you can smoke weed on the side.",1688004807.0

jpucbly,"> I was in NA, they were pissed and told me “if you want to say you’re an addict, you can live like an addict” and made me sleep in my car all weekend dude. I'm so sorry. My parents aren't All Stars or anything but jfc I'm so sorry. Doing the best thing you've done for yourself and they're giving you that shit? Wait until they see what you look like at a year, two years. They'll change their tune. >. I never used to speed like that before I got clean, but now I almost can’t even help it. Par for the course. Humans like RUSHES. Speeding is a RUSH. Now that your brain doesn't get drugs it will seek rushes in other places like overspending, speeding, promiscuous sex, etc. Keep an eye on it and talk to your sponsor about it. All arguably better than using dope. &#x200B; I left the program when I felt I had a handle on why I used. I have love for the program, but I can't do it anymore personally.

jpswx1s,"Hi, unfortunately it sounds like you are suffering from opioid use disorder(OUD). You can google ""DSM opioid use disorder criteria"" and see what the diagnostic statistical manual (DSM) lists as the symptoms or criteria to diagnose someone with OUD. The good news is, you're asking the right questions and reaching out for help. Addiction is a chronic illness, and just like other chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and hypertension, addiction can be successfully treated by a qualified physician. Please reach out to a doctor that specializes in the treatment of substance use disorders, specifically treating opioid use disorder. Its already been mentioned here, but there are medications that can eliminate acute withdrawal symptoms, prevent post acute withdrawal syndrome, and give your brain the stability it needs to regain plasticity and heal. One of the most effective medications is buprenorphine (Suboxone) it saved my life, and along with counseling and building strong support networks, has helped me be in active recovery for over 15 years now. I went from taking pills, norcos, roxi, to smoking black tar heroin in less than nine months. Ended up using for almost two years before finally finding help. You can go from feeling like you have things more or less in check, to spiraling out of control pretty quickly. Reach out for help from your loved ones and close friends. They can support you and help you get into, and stay, in active recovery. Also, while you're still using, make sure you have some Narcan spray on hand, and that someone other than you knows where it is and how to use it to reverse an overdose. Fentanyl is making it into regular street pills and drugs, Narcan can save your life, or someone elses if an OD occurs.",1687916955.0

I do various self soothing behaviors and go through phases where I live with topical ointments, though the management is exhausting at times. Do you feel similarly regarding pain management? I think I also need to rebuild more resiliency with it. But no, the pain is not because of withdrawals. I think I was just in similar pain when I was using, and when a more acutely similar symptom arises, it reinforces the idea/ patterns in my head to a degree.

jppla7l,"My path is similar so i will share. 28 years in AA and experiencing changes, trying to understand them and navigate. During covid I started attending zoom meetings and i was exposed to AA convention speakers often, their polished pro-AA speeches sounded wonderful and seemed to answer my prayers at the time yet i was depressed when i tried to put their suggestions into practice in my own life. Here were people with more sobriety than me telling me the message i have always heard, if you don't feel ok then you must not be working the program hard enough! Our answers lie in those 12 steps and if you commit fully to them god can do wonderful things. I read the pages everyday, i did another 4th and 5th with my new sponsor, i prayed harder and tried to be more honest with myself and instead of improving, i found myself arguing more and more. ""What kind of moron reads the same sentences every morning and never gets bored of them? He made it sound like it was bliss but this is torture"" It seems clear to me now what i required but it was almost impossible for me to break free of the mindset i had acquired in AA. Now on the ""outside"" i see that very naturally if you ONLY go to AA meetings you are ONLY going to hear AA messages. Speakers will occasionally mention something outside AA but they keep it to a minimum, like mentioning drugs, LOL. Sitting in an AA meeting, and trying to tell those other people what was ""wrong"" with that meeting, how it wasn't meeting my needs at that time was painful but that is where i found myself, i had no other sources, so i was stuck. AA is wonderful, AA has so many tools, and therapeutic opportunities and the fellowship it can be enough for a person but if after 20 years of doing the same things you are not ready to reach out of your comfort zone i think god will make you uncomfortable enough to force you to seek answers elsewhere, at least i believe that is what happened to me. In those 28 years I did not join a church, i did not read any other books other than our AA literature over and over and over, there is a whole great big world out there and i was staying in AA and not growing. I have started to hear phrases recently like ""second-tier sobriety"" or ""emotional sobriety"", THIS is exactly what i needed and i had made feeble attempts to reach out before but they were unsuccessful and I gave up and sat and suffered. I do not feel i have to leave AA now, but i DO have to look elsewhere, i can take some of the effort i was putting into AA and use it to find new non-AA books to read \[ Permission to feel - Marc Brackett \] I can seek professional help, I can make new connections and what i experience outside of AA i can bring back and share, i want to be that voice i never heard encouraging others to look outside of AA, it's ok and natural!",1687866989.0
jppd7ig,"Hi! Great question. It was a long road for me getting sober and I was in several rehabs and sober houses before I “got it”. And a big part of that was AA. I was very involved, worked all the steps, and had a sponsor/Sponsees. During year 2, I went through a breakup, moved to a new city, and started to build a beautiful new life for myself. I went to AA here, and I enjoyed the meetings but I also enjoyed all the other lovely things I had discovered I was into that had been dampened by by addiction and relationship. And the community made me feel extremely guilty for only hitting a meeting every other week. I was so scared of all the horror stories about drifting away from AA and I simply won’t survive if I go back to addiction, so I doubled down, got a sponsor, and started going far more often. I never enjoyed it. I didn’t like people saying they were going to relapse if they didn’t go 3 times a week. I didn’t like that if I wasn’t fully enmeshed in the community, that I was an outsider. I didn’t like feeling that if I was dealing with sadness or anxiety, that it was because I wasn’t doing enough for my recovery. I didn’t like the policing of my attendance. After a while, if I missed a meeting, I’d get 3 or so texts asking if I was okay. I started going just to prove I wasn’t back out. ALSO THE CREEPY GUYS WERE OVERWHELMING. And they couldn’t ban anyone from a meeting because “they clearly need this meeting even more than you.” Then my sponsor, the ultimate AA attendee with 7+ years of sobriety relapsed. I honesty felt like I was kind of free to drift away. Then, I was inundated with calls hounding me about my attendance and while it was sweet, it troubled me to think that people thought sobriety hinges on your sponsor or number of meetings attended. It felt like some people just replaced their addiction to substances with addiction to a program. I couldn’t have gotten sober without AA, but AA enabled me to get my life back on track and fill it with things that bring me joy and a TON of coping mechanisms that don’t involve substances. Those are the things I maintain sobriety for, not just to prove to everyone around me how sober I am. I’m coming up on 4 years and I feel stronger than I ever have in my recovery. I know I have a disease but I don’t feel like a relapse is around every dark corner or alleyway. Yes, it’s one day at a time, but stacking a lot of really healthy days together gives you a safety net and clarity. I’m very happy and fulfilled. I hope to drop back into meetings here and there, but for now I maintain contact with a circle of sober friends, go to therapy regularly, and openly talk about my recovery. It is the most important thing in my life because all of the other things hinge on it. But I don’t feel the need to prove that anymore by being involved in AA. Hope this helps!!",1687861726.0

jpk2cha,"The only thing, after reading your story, I (as a non westerner) want to say is that your social system is designed to create addicts. When you become addicted then your health and support system( hospitals, therapies, medicines) tries everything thing to keep you addicted. My fellow human beings in west I am crying at your condition. But I can't do anything for you. Can't even make you understand how you are chained by your elites who run the system. They keep you in dark from ALL THE SIDES. Now for the suggestion you've asked: FEAR, is what makes an impulsive person (yes addiction is due to uncontrolled impulses) remain within boundaries. But in west, Fear of father, punishment by father has been demonised. That is the first step by the elites to unleash your inner demon. (yes every human being is born with an untamed demon). 1. Ask your family to inculcate fear in you of the consequences of you drinking again. RESTRICTIONS: These were there for a reason : to tame your inner demon. But the elites have demonised restrictions instead of real demon inside us. Through utilitarian philosophies and individualism(conditioning, brainwashing, grooming) 2. Ask your family to impose some restrictions on you which can help you stay away from sources of alcohol. (Like ban on the company of those who drink, parties, get togethers where drinking is allowed) 3. Spend 45 days without any kind of highes ( junk food, sweet food, alcohol, emotional highes etc) Don't talk with your father and brother now, because if you will do it, then your image as an alcoholic will gradually become normalised and eventually accepted by them. Let your mother talk with them and tell them to inculcate fear and impose restrictions on you. Don't go to therapy please. Western therapies are designed to further misguide people away from the solution. Don't take any depression medicines, or any sleeping pill, or any antipsychotics. Design your day to keep yourself as busy as possible that when it's night time you can barely keep yourself awake. I can decode western society as a whole and how it is, in its current situation, nothing better than a farm in which humans are kept as animals. Remember, good houses, roads, and good looking buildings were never the definition of success in human history.

jpgrd1u,"TL;DR Your friend is not a failure and has not lost it all. That is a toxic way to think about it and one of the big flaws with many recovery programs. Her progress is not lost. It is only delayed by the days she stays in active addiction. -_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_ My brother is a doctor who runs three heroin recovery centers. Before I went to rehab the first time (for alcohol), we had several long conversations where he taught me how addiction worked and what I needed to get from rehab. His methods involved some cutting edge research but he was having so much success that other hospitals around the countrybstarted using his approach. I think what he explained applies to your friend here. First, how addiction works. Neuroplasticity. Everyone seeks comfort. Nothing wrong with that. We have a reward center in our brain that gives us comfort. When we use alcohol or drugs, we get a flood of comfort and feel-good chemicals in our brain. If we do it enough, our brain adapts because it is monitoring all its systems. If we flood our brains with feel-good chemicals, the brain realizes there's plenty about and slows down manufacturing. Sort of like a farmer who turns off their sprinklers during monsoon season, because there is plenty of rain already. Eventually, we get to the point where our brain gets programmed to want that particular Scooby snack. And it wants it for every situation, good and bad, when we need comfort. Some drugs/alcohol leave us in a state of depleted feel-good chemicals, so we seek comfort, so we want Scooby snack, which leads to more depletion, so we seek more comfort, etc. Cycle continues. Fascinating bit: but the brain is so resilient, too, that on a functional MRI (some kind of scan), a doctor can show how your brain starts healing your comfort center one second after there is no alcohol or drug left in the system. One second. Your goal in recovery is to maximize the time your brain is in that healing state. This is the first half of the problem with counting consecutive days. Imagine you have a dream job/life in California waiting. You pack up your car and start driving across the country. After a few states you pull into a town, get a bottle, pull into a rest area, drink it, and then stumble around and sleep it off. Next morning, you get back on the road. Have you lost all the miles youve driven so far? NO. You have only delayed your arrival to your dream job/dream life by the amount of time you spent at the rest area. This isnt ""good"" or ""bad"". It was just a choice, and that choice delayed your arrival. No matter how many rest stops along the way, once you dry up and get back on the road, you are on your way again. The second half of the problem about counting consecutive days has to do with guilt vs shame. Guilt is ""I pulled that girl's ponytail in the cafeteria at lunch. That doesnt represent the kind of person I want to be. Im going to apologize and Im not going to do that again."" Shame, on the other hand, is guilt plus a moral judgment or name calling added. ""I pulled that girl's ponytail in the cafeteria at lunch. That doesnt represent the kind of person I want to be. Im going to apologize and Im not going to do that again. I am a bad person. Why do I always make stupid choices? Im such an idiot'. Im so useless."" Important: the problem is, shame is always toxic and it is always a lie. It is a toxic relationship with yourself that we are taught to have even though it is 100% dysfunctional. You know the old ""don't judge others"" people quote? Well, we are judging ourselves. Judging is evaluating some people as good, so they deserve praise and to go to heaven, and judging others as bad, so they deserve punishment and hell. But the source of that same ""dont judge me"" quote says that only God can judge because only God knows the whole story. No one else decides about heaven and hell. That quote is from a religious source, thats why Im using religious terms. The secret my brother told me is that shame is the cause of (at least nearly) all relapses. Someone slips up. Its just a slip. Its just a delay to getting to dream life but they act like they have to start the trip all over again. You dont. We slip, then we say we've fucked it all up, then we say we are such losers, such failures, such idiots, and keep kockong ourselves until we are very down. And what do we seek when we are down? Comfort. You know where this is going. He had a patient who shot up heroin 10x a day for 25 years. Then he gets sober, then goes out and 2.5 weeks later shoots up twice. Next day he is in my brother's office sobbing. My brother says ""are you kidding? That's great progress! You went from 10x a day to 2x in 2.5 weeks. Thats like a 90% reduction. The rest of the time you were healing. Thats the direction you want."" So a person would do better by counting the total miles theyve driven towards their dream job, not from the last rest stop. You count the days that you have been drug-free or sober and in that healing state. Even if you have a slip, you keep going. Yes, AA and NA do emphasize one continuous run. And its true that not wanting to break our continuous run might be part of our motivator for wanting to stay sober today. A little part of it, though, might be motivated by the fear of shame. While we are making progress, that not healthy motivation (shame) might be useful because it helps us stay on track. But ultimately it is not a healthy motivator. We want to be moving this direction because we want to heal and we realize that addiction is unhealthy and damages things that matter to us. (Remember that NA and AA books dont talk about counting days. That is a tradition that was invented to help celebrate milestones. And remember the people in NA and AA each have their own view on things. This post isnt gospel but it is based on science plus a successful track record of treating patients to continue on their path.) But slips/relapses is where the continuous counting part fails, if we continue to allow shame in our lives. Dont think in terms of good and bad. Think in terms of helpful vs not helpful, constructive vs destructive. That slip was temporarily helpful to deal with the emotions associated with recent tragedy. And it did help, temporarily. However, it is not helpful to getting back to a healthy state. It is not helpful to rebuilding a happy life. It is destructive to our health, even though it helped through that moment. What we need is to find other, more constructive ways, to cope with high stress situations that wont cause us harm. And that will let us meet the next challenge in life in a way that we can stay sober to do it, and in that way we will become a stronger person who can handle life as it happens. Eventually we may be able to get rid of all our toxic reactions and will find healthy ways to deal with stuff. And then nothing can stop us because we become a full grown tree in that survives the storms. Hope this helps. I have had to learn all this myself. And I keep having to re-learn this. A happier, healthier life is waiting for us if we keep moving towards it! Cheers.",1687700477.0

It’s as simple as when she’s ready again there’s a way out.

jpfcqyj,"I haven't felt any withdrawal because I only feel like I am back to who I was before take ritalin or adderall. I've had brain fogs and zaps before mediation from being burnt out from work and overloading information into my brain. I also had sleeping issue and anxiety disorder in the past. I'm on Strattera now and the first week I was just feeling sleepy all day. Now I am at week 2 and I think it's getting me little more functional but my insomnia hasn't been fixed but it is helping with my anxiety. I definitely don't freak out when I don't complete my todo list for the day. Work-wise, I am little less distracted but I definitely cannot concentrate as I did with Adderall. Since I didn't feel any withdrawal symptoms I think I rather go back to Adderall and taking separate medication for my anxiety disorder. I was on 30mg of XR for the morning and 30mg of the normal one in the afternoon so I can articulate my thoughts better with my wife after work. I know I had lost of appetite when I was on Ritalin and Adderall but I usually overeat. Even with Strattera I don't have much of an appetite but I do eat little more than when I used to be on Ritalin. My insomnia was never from Adderall or Ritalin, it always has been not being able to stop thinking about something that's in my head. Probably related to my anxiety disorder but my thoughts are not always something that troubles me. Half the time it's some idea I have that I want to create and I just go overboard with it and end up researching it until morning. I've had this problem even before I was on medication. I feel Adderall affects individuals differently.",1687663705.0
jpf7zqo,"I had to get out of my head and that meant getting out of my comfort zone. I’m used to keeping to myself and toward the end of my drinking I was isolated. Things got better for me when I started going to meetings just to be around people at first. It got me out of my head and it was an actual action instead of a never ending internal list of shit I should be doing someday. Holding it all in didn’t serve me anymore and it never did. It doesn’t have to be meetings NA or AA, but it’s a good start and it’s free. I think people in recovery understand and want to help. I sure as fuck do.",1687660968.0
jpf5kgv,That’s totally normal. Fear was a main contributor to keeping me drinking. I was afraid of what’s underneath and I ran from it. It gets easier and it gets much better as time goes on. Lots of people helped me along the way and allowing myself to be helped and say thank you was a huge hurdle I needed to jump early on. There’s support out there and probably more than you think. It’s what you pick up along the way from others that will help guide you. You’re not alone.,1687659601.0
jpeswu5,"Congrats on the time and choosing recovery. I think sobriety is all about getting into that stuff as painful as it may be. It’s work but it’s worth it. I don’t consider myself recovered because I still have shit load to learn. I’m about 4 years sober and I feel like I’m still new. Talking with others has been a huge help. I wanted to change and I wanted the freedom I saw in other sober people so I did what they did. I started showing up, I got connected to others and eventually I found a sponsor and worked the steps. I have a therapist who is also a person in recovery and we get into some heavy shit but I only see them once every 2 weeks. It’s not enough for me. I feel better when I do something everyday and the easiest thing to do is to get out of my head. I had to get out of my comfort zone because all those thoughts weren’t serving me well. I was replaying all those moments alone and just as isolated as I was when I was out there drinking and drugging. I found a way to let go of the idea that I now beat and found some willingness to take action. It’s awesome that your young and you’ve found sobriety. Keep at it and try to get out of your head. If your anything like me, staying inside your head all day is a scary fucking place.",1687652664.0
jpe91yy,"Sweetheart. In all honesty you're not going to make it with the plans you don't have. You have got yourself set up for nothing but failure. Look, I'm being brutally honest because this is your life on the line here. Think about it. Say you just had a baby and tomorrow you get to go home from the hospital with the new baby. However, it's your first baby. You didn't plan while you were pregnant so you have no clothes, no diapers, no formula, no diaper bag, no stroller, in fact you don't even have a car or a place to live. How well would you expect things to go? They wouldn't go well at all. You would struggle so bad to keep your head above water and keep that baby alive. Now let's say that baby is your new found sobriety. You haven't prepared even an inch for it. And if you don't make some real decisions quickly, you can expect to find yourself strung out on the street with a dead baby. Here are my suggestions. 1. You need more time at the facility if at all possible to get some things in line. 2. You MUST GET A SPONSOR IMMEDIATELY! I'm not sure how you ended up with a sponsor you've never met, but now you need to find someone on your own and you yourself need to ask them to be your sponsor. Find someone who has what you want and find out how they got it, then do everything you can to get it for yourself. If your sponsor says jump you start jumping. If they say stand on your head, then get your feet in the air and ask questions later. 3. Sober living is a must. Go to a halfway house, then move to a three quarter house. If you don't know if your country has them, LOOK FOR ONE! Ask the counselors, ask around at the meetings. Network! The more sober people on your side the better. 4. No more once or twice a week meetings. YOU MUST GO ONCE OR TWICE A DAY. And don't just show up. Do more. Share. Network. Tell your story. Do service work. I understand being skeptical about the program but let's be honest, you have nothing else. So you must go. You can however attend smart meetings online but you need to go in person and network. You need to make as many sober friends as possible. If you follow these steps compared to the nothing of a plan you have right now you'll definitely be better off but it won't be enough. Get honest with yourself. I truly wish you the best. My heart goes out to every addict still stuck in the never ending pain of addiction. But if you want to make it, you have to get a plan together. Waiting until six days out to even start asking some questions about the next step wasn't very smart but that's where you are. What's even worse in my mind is that the facility you are at didn't do any of this with you. Why haven't they set up any type of after care for you?? What county are you in btw? If you let us know where you are located maybe we can try to help find resources for you. Best of luck. Stay strong, if you want it, you can have it but it takes work and it isn't for pu$$y$.",1687642650.0

jpcqac6,"I've been sober for 35 years and I have seem some shit. The trick is this....do whatever you have to do to stay sober for the period of time you can make whether that be 5 minutes or one day. Remember that the difficultly gradually reduces over time. You will get to the place where it is no longer a daily thought. Beware of substituting other substances. While it may work to get started in some cases (amd may be required to safely deto), it keeps the mental obsession going. Which sucks giant balls. At some point the mental obsession will wear you down. I started in NA. It was a good overall program. Try to ignore any of the sayings or common practices that just seem untenable to you. I could not have stayed sober if I hadn't had it pointed out to me 1000 times that only a desire to quit is required. I absolutely bristle at any form of control. There are a lot of us like that. We can stay clean and sober too. It helps to keep a moderately open mind and recognize that all that 12 step stuff is collected wisdom. I still don't agree with all of it, but different pieces have been helpful at different times. Shame and guilt are not required to stay clean and sober. Reviewing behavior to make better choices next time is useful tho. They are very much not the same thing. Lots of people get confused about this. Best of luck to you fellow traveler!

I completely connected to this because I've been suicidal too and had to go for treatment. But this is a step in the right direction: keep asking for help, keep forcing yourself to talk to someone, call helplines. Anythung to get it out of your head and into the world.

You sound like you need supervision and security. Maybe vet your options and see if one is a good fit?

jp7yi2s,PAWS is pretty standard for anyone whose been addicted to something for years. Until you find a way to handle that anger and where it stems from.. rather it's stress related or otherwise. You could just be an angry person and this irritability is giving you the excuse to act on it. I'm a smoker myself. Quit for 3 years to vaping and then went back to smoking cause of all that vape hate bs. 20 years later I'm cutting down from a pack a day to pack every 36 to 48 hours. Vapes are addictive too and alot of work. All the chemicals and risk of overhearing and exploding. Plus I want to quit smoking lmao so switching to vaping isn't gonna help me. I've found its hardest to handle not smoking when triggered. Or the standard things like. After sex. After eating. Wheb you take a shyt. And of course when your angry or irriated. Your way out when triggered used to be. Ima go vape.. now you don't have that. Like any habit.. it needs to be broken and reprogrammed. Rather find a new outlet or find the source of your anger. Goodluck to you. And stay strong don't give in! Ima get there one day myself but I'm detoxing off suboxone first haha.,1687527117.0
jp7x38u,Lmao I see why there's no comments to this. If your playin this game even tho it doesn't even give you much enjoyment. It's the same reason most people do drugs.. Your bored... running. . .hiding. or escaping. you literally nothing else to do that's easy and rewarding.. but literally meaningless distraction. And it's just easier then doing shyt in real life because it doesn't matter if you fuck up in a game. Helping people In Game gives you makes you feel like you've achieved something. Like you matter. That's a high in itself. It's an escape from your own thoughts cause life isn't great and you ain't got real priorities. Not judging. That's pretty all I do too. Cept I KNOW why I do it. If you are actually serious and this isn't a joke.. You play games and feel this way about it cause you lack purpose. Period. It's not engaging you anymore so you question it. But you also can't stop cause.. wtf else you gonna do... Find some new games that is one time pay. And beat it. 100% that way when your done your done. But one 60$ can last you weeks or months. Without pressure of pay to win to advance. Make youtube tutorials. Or write some faqs whenever new games come out. Or go out and find a purpose. Volunteer if you wana help people. Soup kitchen. Or animal shelter. Etc. Honestly reading this I thought it was a spoof at first. Just a complete joke. Not saying gaming isn't an addiction. Addiction is addiction. We all running from something. But you just sound sooo friggin insincere..its hard to get others to care when you don't even sound like you do.,1687526453.0
jp7s6l2,Actually.. that's true. If you are ever at the point where your at the edge and it's not a thought anymore.. you can always check yourself into a psych ward. (ER) will transfer you to the nearest facility if you can't find one near you) Find a decent one with decent food haha it makes all the difference. They can't deny you if your tell them your gonna hurt yourself or others. There's usually addicts. Suicide risks. And homeless people there. It's usually never people who are crazy. It's not an actual looney bin. It's a chance to let them diagnose you. Try out different medications. Talk to psychiatrists and you get a bed. 3 meals a day and snacks. It can rather help you get the help you need.. or trap you for a couple days to weeks depending on medicaid insurance.. but when you get out you'll find a new sense of freedom. And you'll want to do all the things haha.,1687524001.0
jp7rk88,Your friends death if anything made you feel more ok with doing it too.. but another way to to look at it is like.. with your siblings so young and impressionable.. do you think your suicide would tell them it's ok to do it too? If your in control this is what you would probably feel.. but because your are suicidal anything would be skewed to convince you its ok.. Being aware that these aren't your real feelings . Being here telling us is you trying to overcome them. I really think you should tell someone that you know. So you can hold yourself accountable to it.. if your scared to talk about it and have a conversation. You can always say something like: I need to tell you I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts.. ima trying to get help. I'm not in control. I'm not ready to talk about it yet. Just needed to tell you because you matter to me. I'm okay. But I'm acknowledging that I need help.,1687523672.0

jp7p65k,Ps. I've given up for the last 10 years. Been to jail and in and out of psych wards across the state. And city.. I have so many regrets and anxiety. Depression mania.. but I could never end it just because I don't care about shyt anymore.. because as bad it things are dying only makes it worse for those you care about. Look at what your friends death did to you.. do you really want that for others? To show your siblings it's okay to do that? Please tell your family what your feeling. Ask them for help.. talk to them. Because your not in control right now. And you gotta give yourself to chance to get back in that driver's seat. This is coming from someone whose been crawling slowly back up from oblivion.. I aint there yet. But everyday any chance I have to prove my love for my friends I'm there. Maybe they've judged me for my past. But that's because they care about me.. at the end of the day.. if they answer the phone.. there's a chance to mend that relationship. You can't keep comparing yourself and situation to the past.. I've been there. We all miss our teenage years. Or our 20s.. But age and trauma . Experiences change people.. it happens to everyone. I also struggle with anxiety . I can't handle when people I kno look me in the eyes. Stage fright type of situation. Everyone is more carefree when they're young.. and stupid haha Your alive.. which means you still have that chance to figure out who you are now.. and who you want to be. A fighter.. a survivor.. or someone who doesn't even care enough to try. Give yourself time and opportunities. Don't say no don't make excuses to not go out. Just take the leap.. cause whats the worst that could happen? You die? Lmao Ps. My phone anxiety is the worst. Can't pick up the phone it's really hard. But that stems from somewhere. Your anxiety and depression.. it all stems from some type of trauma or fear.. it can be replaced and overcome. Anytime there's an event or birthday my anxiety tells me to bail.. but my heart says Go. And each time I force myself to go. It gets little less of a lie. And my personality comes back more and more because your more relaxed. Your less haunted by your guilt and judgement. I've realized that it's our own state of mind.. no one else sees it that way.. or thinks about what your thinking in a negative sense. They're going thru their own issues.. When we are stuck in this self loathing self hate and judgement.. then of course we're gonna be feeling that way. But the only way to get out of that mindset is to go through it. Your transitioning into the next stage of your life.. its just up to you how long it takes you to get there. The more exposure you put yourself through the more secure you'll be.. One of my difficulties right now is I want to go out.. but not all the time.. so finding people to just dick around with. But not having to commit to is hard. it isn't easy making friends you can trust on a whime.. but there are places that let's you meet new people. And you can always start there find a group acrivity on craigslist or groupon. It just depends what kind of exposure you need.. go take a horse riding lesson. haha. Ice always wanted to but I'm still too lazy. The agoraphobia is real. Being arrested x2 for nothing has made me think I'm at risk anytime anywhere.,1687522360.0
jp7o147,I'm not here to judge you but you gotta remember that it won't be this way forever.. And if your already at that point of fuck it im ready to leave this world and let me family deal with the reprecussions of my decision.. then what do you have to lose? Why not go out and say fuck it to being whoever you want and talkin to people. Of your not afraid to die.. hell why would you be afraid of sayin the wrong thing to people that may or may not matter. Your life Can literally only go up from here... Your friend Died.. If her ghost came to visit you.. what do you think they would say. Your alive.. you can literally do whatever you want.. its the lack of motivation in wanting to.. Is it fear of rejection? Figuring out why you feel this way is the first step. The fact that your posting this proves you don't want to die.. It's just easier then confronting these demons or what if. And feeling down.. Giving yourself permission to make mistakes and find your happiness that's what being alive is all about. If you killed yourself your not just ending your own life.. your parents and siblings lives would never be the same. If anything happened to my kid.. I'd go on a murder spree of pedos .. then sacrifice my life to save someone else's. Cause my own life would be over. Next time you feel suicidal really think about what finding your body would do to your parents. What they would feel.. how woukd they handle your funeral. How much that would cost. Is that all your life is worth? If you can't do it for you. Live for them. Go help your siblings and parents. Go out and help someone. Volunteer somewhere with a cause you care about. It's different if really didn't care about your family. Or anyone or anything.. then nothing really matters does it.. But if you do care ... then survive for them. Cause everyday that your on this earth is another opportunity to feel better. Another chance to find something to live for. Another day where anything can happen and your life could change in an instance. You just gotta want to give yourself that chance.,1687521707.0
jp7mhmm,Retraining your brain is the hardest part. If it's the hardest at night I suggest filling out the day so you can just sleep it off at night. And shocking the body out of the thought spiraling. Anytime you get even start getting uncomfortable shock it with a walk. Or shower. Again. Get a puppy haha a small one. Or a cat. Something that relies on you but isn't stressful or too much work that it triggers you. Cuddling and playin with them helps alot. Being alone or bored is Def not good for WDs Finding something to replace those moments of giving in is the real challenge,1687520797.0
jp7l3d8,"Wow one bag . 2 to 3 weeks Holy shyt. It would never make it past the end of the night lmao. That's incredible you've already got the want and motivation. And shyt ton of will power. It's just the mental side now. I'm in kinda the same boat myself but with suboxone.< Don't do it. Not worth it. One subs lasts me 2 to 4 days. Break it into little pieces and only take it when WD gets unbearable. At this point it's not even to get high right? It's legit just to feel better . And any ""high"" is just from not feeling like shyt anymore. Or wheb you get triggered. But takin that plung with endure past the WDs is the hardest goddamn part .. I feel you girl. Also had an ex that just showed up with drugs.. with and for. I knew this mofo just came thru for a safe place to do the drugs.. and maybe sex. One day I just stopped letting him in. Eventually he will stop showing up. Let him yell and throw shyt. Block him. Whatever you gotta do keep him out of your life. Tell your dealer if he's a friend your done. And if he cares he won't sell to you anymore. If he isn't. Delete his number. H isn't the drug to keep on hand. Think about the reprecussions.. its the number 1 most harshly punished and judged drug on the street. If you can't go cold turkey maybe find a substitute. Trust me.. a cop is more willing to let you go with coke residue then H. H put in me jail 3 times and I wasn't even on it 2 of 3 of those times.. just being labeled with it and having that record.. it isn't forgiving. It's Har. The WD from it are like no other. But the good thing about that and not Prescription shyt is the physical WDs don't like more then a week. And at your dosage.. its gonna be super mild compared to shooting up or bundle a day. But it's still gonna be hell mentally. If anyone in your life knows.. I suggest telling them and having them know keeps you accountable. Someone to tell about your symptoms and if your spiraling. To keep you grounded. Plus if they kno your way less likely to pick up. The more pain your in tho. The better youll feel when that week is over. remember this motto. It won't last. Then the mental WDs.. distraction. Distraction. Distraction. Get a puppy.. go hold some babies.. and eat yogurt. Spinach and pickled foods to reset your receptors. There's lot of different food that help with flushing out your receptors but that's a huge part of the mental side. It's not in your head. It's real. Your receptors are waiting to get flooded so when their depleted your gonna feel so down and lost. It's science.. so go flood them with other REAL LIFE happy things. Keep a diary or video. So you can document your misery. Your feelings.. wheb it geta real bad and when it starts getting better...and when your fixing to use rewatch it. As a reminder to never go thru this again.. And lastly. Don't get dishearted.. if you have a real bad day. Remember your dealing with brain chemicals.. your receptors and your body will crash at some point. It take time to replace those bumps of H. With other happy moments. Find a replacement. A healthy alternative rather it's going on a date. Going dancing. Junk food..or Cheesecake..or even Takin a shot lmao.or having a beer. Or walkin your new puppy. If you start spiraling. Run outside and just start stretching haha. Just shock your body out of it. Shower.. scream.. icecream.. watch a show your really into. Take up a exercise class with other people in it. Replacing those bumps with happy little moments is everything.",1687519935.0
jp7inr6,In the end tho.. if it's having a negative impact on your mental health. You need to do what's right for you. Cause at the end of the day you can even help him if your feeling those feelings of resentment or ..not ok you kno. And it doesn't help anyone if your just at each other's throats. If it aint a healthy environment gtfo. But if your with him. Don't nag or stress him. Support him you kno? Help him figure it out. Let him kno you don't judge him. Let him kno how you feel in a no judgement way without blame. And figure out a plan together to tackle his triggers. If your really trying though. But he wont.. then yea he won't get better until he loses everything and hits rock bottom. Alot of times addiction can't be overcome until the reason their doing it is gone and its replaced by the consequences of getting high.,1687518338.0
jp7if9h,I'm an addiction myself. But I also dealt with a similar situation. It's a hard situation because if a addict wants to use.. They're gonan use. An there nothing we can really do about it. If you stay it's like your enabling them but if you go it's like your abandoning them. I don't want to steer you eitherway.. But I will say this. What your seeing.. and what they're doing when on meth.. there's a disconnect. They're in the driver's seat. And when they're off the meth everything is gonna make them feel worse about it. Hits them all at once so if you do stay.. don't stress him out about it cause that's just gonan make him feel worse and turn to meth. You can hold him accountable. Really talk to him about why.. what he's really feeling. Help him figure out why he keeps needing to escape. What is he trying to hide from. Let him kno it's ok to feel all these feelings . It doesn't sound like he's doing horrible things tho so he doesn't sound too far gone. It jaut sounds like he's trying but he turns to meth cause he gets triggered here and there.. but why you kno. All addicts are Ashamed at heart. But try to hide it by acting like they don't give. A fuck. Or it ain't a big deal. But they're also not in control . It's hard and it really depends on the situation. If he's at the point where he's choosing meth over everything tho. Then he's gotta rock bottom. But if it's here and there and he's functioning still.. then yea I believe he's relapsing to hide from something cause something is triggering it.,1687518178.0
jp7gug8,I've been right where you are tho. To not want to be on something... but feel like your worse off if you dont. That's also why I personally think your not ready yet... but meth isn't the answer. They have prescriptions now that are safer . Find a medical crutch until your ready.. I'm actually lookin into Sublocade cause it's monthly injection.. just to get out of the habit of takin something everyday. But medicaid is an issue for me.. I highly suggest getting off the street drugs because they keep you in that mental fog and that is a place of constant fear and anxiety..and paranoia.. not to mention it's expensive. My drug of choice is cocaine and opiates. I smoked crack for abit to come down off the coke as well.. so I'm not sure what can help with meth but if your smoking it maybe find a vape with a strong base to alleviate that urge in combination with some type of prescription that gives you some type of high. I know alot of people reading this who doesn't have an addiction issue won't understand and will judge me for this but I dont care. This is your life were talkin bout... You could try suboxone films for that daily hit.. cut them up and take a tiny piece whenever I feel like I'm spiraling. Just try to not stay on it for years cause it's cumulative the longer on it the longer it takes to get off. Months to years. They say it's safe to be on throughout your life though. It's just a matter of preference. If it came down to doing meth for life.. or doing subxone for life.. I know what I'd choose.,1687517078.0
jp7fpbn,"I' found this thread cause I'm in the same bout. Cept after 10 years of Suboxone Maintenance that's become what my body relies on. I'd take a week of intense heroine withdrawals over months of physical and mental withdrawals. I'm currently Tapering off. Last 18 days I've taken less then 6 subxone pills. But the fact that it feels like there's no end to it makes it so much harder. The physical symptoms are horrible but nothing compared to the anxiety. Depression and mania. I'm scared to talk to or see my friends when I'm like this . Worried and stress about important events and shyt that needs to get done. And it makes it all so much worse. I'm not one to be giving advice.. but I'd suggest you do things that make yourself accountable. Tellin those that matter to you what your feeling and going through. Not for advice or pity but just so they KNOW. It makes a huge difference for me at least. Cause I feel like if they didn't know. Then there's nothing stopping me from just giving in and "" picking up"" or just giving up in general. Having. Back up plan helps.. like if you find your starting to spiral. Have someone you can go to and just vent . Don't be alone. Or record yourself so you can keep yourself accountable. Do a video diary. Or even upload your experience. It's always gonna get worse before it can get better. That's 100% true... just need to remember it Won't always be this way.. even if your not sure. Cause I'm not... But if you don't give your mind and body the chance to recover without the ability to just mask it with meth then your brain / receptors won't have the chance to balance out over time. It took me 10 years of being on suboxone to get to a point mentally where I've recovered enough to say ok.. I'm well enough now that maybe I can take the next step to get off subxone too. But when I first went to jail.. and they deprived me of all my prescriptions omg was it hell on earth. No joke I couldn't sleep for 45 days straight. I never want to go back to that. So wheb I got out I stayed off the meds and it took 2 years to Un zombify and get back in the driver seat. It all takes time... But if your having visual or audiatory episodes when your coming down you might be alittle schizophrenic.. and thats no joke you need medication for that.. men actually developed that around age 27 without having symptoms their whole lives.. Ptsd. Depression. Trauma. Addiction that's all contributing to it as well so maybe something to look into. At any point tho if your doctor isn't working for you. Find another one. Don't let them put you on more medication you don't actually need . I used take 25+ pills. They gave me something every single side effect instead of just solving the issues.. its what happens wheb no one cares.. My main advice is to write things down. Find out for yourself what makes you tick. What's are you feeling. Why? Try to relate it to your symptoms and suicidal thoughts. Then reaffirm why you won't do it. Ex. My family my friends.. Cause your life means more then you kno and just giving up for any reason other then to save another's is gonna be a life wasted..",1687516229.0

jp6bjg9,"It doesn’t matter what someone is addicted to, the addiction is in the brain, the same brain you use to make decisions and carry out daily functions. Addiction to drugs and/or alcohol is more complicated than addiction to say cigarette or caffeine, in that drugs and alcohol are poisons that effect how the brain functions and how you think and behave. It why addicts are known for doing super stupid stuff flexible fucked up. A brain addicted to drugs or alcohol will create thoughts and cravings for the substance. It’s almost impossible to think your way out of this… this is the “I want to, but I don’t want to thinking”. The “I want to quit” thoughts are yours. The “I don’t want to… don’t not how to survive without the substance” is the addition speaking”. Sound crazy… that’s because addicts are crazy in the head…insane… especially while using… They literally have 2 voices in their head each competing for something. One wants you to live and the other wants to kill you. The more you feed the one that wants to kill you the stronger that voice gets until one day the voice that wants you to live is no longer heard. That is late stage addiction. That is the stage where the brain is so damaged by and hooked on the substance that it will get you to do anything to keep feeding it what it wants thereby keeping the addiction alive. It wants more and more and more until your either locked up or covered up. My suggestion. Go to rehab and get sobered up. The only way to get unhooked is to do the opposite of what your addiction is making you think you need..which is just one more…. And on your own… its unlikely you’ll be able to have the common sense to say no to it…. The itch will get so strong your scratch it…. That’s what relaps is all about. Get help and stay there until you can think clearly. Go to AA or NA or CA. Get a sponsor and do what they suggest. You’ll find support and you’ll find people who learned how to beat the cravings and live happy normal lives. It’s and ugly ugly disease. I pray you find help. It gets a lot better.",1687487737.0

Do you think people with high blood pressure or diabetes have to deal with shame when getting treatment for their illnesses?

There are medications that can help with cravings and withdrawal. Also try and find an individual counselor that has experience in substance use disorders. A one on one approach might work better for you. It might take you a few attempts to find a counselor you click with, my rule is to look for someone new if i dont feel a connection after the first 3 to 4 sessions (going twice a week, once a week minimum early in recovery).

I use to go to NA when I was younger but it never worked (due to me not being willing to try something new) Got clean without NA and thought I was above that. What I learned with this last relapse though, is that abstinence is not the whole answer. The drinking and using is a byproduct of our disease. I'm going to NA now and work the program. 90% of AA, NA, CA ect... is working on those personality ""defects"" so you can live a happier, more fulfilling life with support from others who understand.

Then used for 2 months. Then something clicked I can’t explain and I quit. I sympathize with you very much because I am your husband in this story. My wife was going through the exact same thing as me. I took her through the ringer. We are still together and now expecting. Everyone is different.

joyqufl,"Coming from someone who had imposter syndrome for the same reason as you, here is my experience. My main drug of choice is marijuana, and also used too much psychedelics. I didn’t have a good relationship with alcohol either. But by an large, i just binged on marijuana all the time. I was very sensitive to the effects of it. I totaled my car at about 40 mph when I was greened out on edibles and should have died based on how the car looked. I was unscathed. I kept using and ended up in a drug induced psychotic episode that led me to wander into strangers apartments, smoke in the aisles of Target, try to break into cars, and yell at pedestrians. These all were because my delusions convinced me I was being followed, was in danger, or that God was prompting me to do those things. I had visions, one where I took an elevator up to the garden of Eden. I alternated between feeling like God and the Devil. I was convinced I was the second coming of Christ and that I was going to be fast tracked to the presidency. I was convinced my roommates were stealing my identity and using invisibility cloaks to spy on me. This is just the tip of the iceberg of the list of delusions I had. I was detained for acting bizarre in the lobby of my apartment and was taken to a mental hospital where I was for 3 days. I was put on a wide assortment of meds to bring me back down to earth, then I went to rehab for over 3 months which was the longest they could legally keep me. I was very resistant to treatment for awhile because I was convinced I was not an addict. I had spent $5000 on marijuana in a 3 month period, my job performance went to shit, my relationships were ruined, I had a near death experience due to my drug use, and I was institutionalized because I was a danger to myself and others. I now, after 2 years and 4 months of sobriety, continue to have psychedelic visuals in my vision permanently and also causes me to dissociate a lot. But in my mind I was still not an addict. During and after rehab I was suicidal for 6 months. And had strong cravings for the first year. So I guess I’m saying this to explain that marijuana is underestimated for how much it can fuck up someone’s life. If you happen to be sensitive to it like myself, it can definitely lead to psychosis, and psychosis can lead to extremely dangerous and deadly outcomes. It can also lead to blackouts, and the blackout led to me totaling my car, and I could have easily killed somebody or myself. Now for you, maybe it doesn’t destroy your life quite as severely as it did for me. But I highly doubt you had a healthy relationship with marijuana if you ended up in recovery meetings. And yes, there are varying degrees of addiction, and addiction to different drugs looks different and each person looks different when addicted. There is a lot of diversity in the experience of addiction, and there is a spectrum from mild to severe addiction in my opinion. The term addict is used as a blanket term to give people in NA solidarity. It helps you to look at the similarities and not the differences. In reality, addiction is a very individual experience, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution as the 12-Steppers might have you believe. I found recovery dharma to be very helpful, moreso than 12 step because the people were more self-aware and open to hearing me share about mental health. I haven’t been to a 12 step meeting in a year and a half and honestly my recovery got better when I found different meetings. Also, 12 step may work for some individuals and that is awesome. I also felt like an imposter at 12 step meetings when I first started out. My sponsor urged me to always look at the similarities and not the differences. Sure, I hadn’t ever overdosed and I hadn’t been through opiate withdrawal and I hadn’t been to jail yet. But my addiction set me back in life, destroyed several relationships, nearly took my life, I had the obsession and the cravings, my work suffered, I narrowly escaped being arrested several times, overall the similarities are what mattered. What mattered is that I didn’t have a healthy relationship to substances at all. My relationship to substances was self-damaging. I imagine your relationship to it is also self-damaging. I would suggest exploring other programs, especially recovery dharma and smart recovery. They’re more open to the idea that addiction looks different for everyone. The people there have been more open minded and understanding in my opinion. Honestly, they have a lot of people who were misfits in 12 step programs. For me, that’s where I found my recovery community, and my recovery got much better than when I was strictly in 12 step.",1687357667.0

jotpmi9,"I dealt with (and am dealing with) the same thing. I’m clean now for 9 months and some change, which is the longest I’ve ever been clean. I primarily abused Weed, Kratom, and prescription stimulants. But weed was always my DOC. Getting clean from weed after abusing it for a significant period of time is no joke, especially with concentrates! Attending NA was difficult for me for a while for the reasons you listed. I saw a lot of “hard” addicts who had been on the streets, in prisons/institutions, and lost everything. Meanwhile I felt like I was doing the kiddie versions of the drugs people talked about that ruined their lives. For the first few months, my mind constantly tried to talk me out of the program. Somehow, I stayed, and thank god I did. After long enough with regular attendance at a couple of good meetings, and sharing honestly about what I was feeling at those, I started to make some connections, including with my sponsor. I was able to share with some people privately the imposter syndrome I was feeling and how I was thinking about seeking other options. Those people happened to be former “hard” addicts, and each of them reassured me that I was right where I needed to be. I kept coming back, and intend to keep coming back. I love NA and am so grateful for it. It took me 6 months to feel fully comfortable in NA, have a regular service commitment, start to have friends, the whole 9 yards. But I still deal with that imposter syndrome at times. I just shared about it at a Saturday meeting. But in my time clean I have realized that there are many addicts who struggle with the same feelings in NA. I have met other marijuana addicts too. The cool thing is some of those weed addicts have told me that they appreciate me sharing honestly about my imposter syndrome and not feeling “addict enough.” Moving forward, I like to think that my role of service in NA is to help addicts who don’t feel “addict enough” to stay in the rooms and recover. Keep coming back, OP!! I would also try to hit some in-person meetings if that is a possibility for you. The power of hugs and human touch has helped me so much in recovery. Feel free to DM me if you want to chat more. Keep reminding yourself of the third tradition: the only requirement for membership is the desire to stop using!!!",1687265470.0

jot602j,"I know what you mean. It's helped me a lot to learn that more and more people are going to rehab/seeking help solely for marijuana addiction. The more I've talked about it as my DOC, the more people I've met in the exact same boat. Just as valid as any other addiction, chemically addictive or not (like gambling, exercise, disordered eating, and the many other types of ""non-addictive"" drugs people still get addicted to). Like you, alcohol was a close second for me, but weed was what I would do anything for I spent as much money every week as someone addicted to down- fuck, it made me homeless man! It's crazy, I do street outreach and work at a treatment center, and its nuts how many people I meet from all walks of life who would do anything for their weed before all other substances. I'm 7 years clean dude, keep talking about this shit, cause I hear you and reading this helped me today too. Take care, and know you are not alone!",1687251866.0
josuob9,"I can relate. I used to feel similarly. I think those feelings have waned almost completely. Almost ;) Two thoughts: 1) Our heads will tell us whatever they could to separate us from the solution. Its a perfect manipulation - Im not as bad, people will reject me because of it, NA wont work - to keep you disconnected and ultimately using again. Its a LIE. And because you are an addict it makes sense that you are having those thoughts. Its absolutely normal. And if you shared about it in meetings people WILL relate. Try to be mindful during one meeting of the similarities and when you start finding differences, bring it back. I bet you can still relate to many regardless of drug of choice 2) The ONLY requirement for membership is the desire to stop using. You meet this requirement. Your seat has been earned. You are a member when you say you are…Its the foundation of our group. Dont let anyone tell you otherwise, if you encounter this the person doesn’t know what they are talking about. Ill say it again. You earned your seat. Its awesome you are getting into the steps. Thats where the program is. I would be curious to hear how your thoughts have developed after working all twelve.

josptju,"Its interesting that we do offer a new way of life and my character flaws as an addict, many either have some or in lesser severity perhaps. If she came, came clean about her selling...might there be something we could do to help? Are you afraid its her attempted at hiding out or trying to please a judge or PO? I have known family members of addicts who after witnessing their loved ones celebrate...want to learn more and what we might have to offer...compassion. As long as their family member is not anonymous to them and they're ok with it, WELCOME. I did speak up once (perhaps out of my zone) to a wife of an addict that was coming to surveil that her husband was in meetings. I told her he can hang with me and either she could wait outside so he could feel free to share and/or meet some people freely. 2 weeks later I was as friendly with her ans with her husband and she had taken my advice and started NAR-ANON meetings while he was in ours. I was such a stickler and rigid with our traditions and practices (a real prick) but as I continued to work on myself became open to allowing some things to occur by themselves. Observe, Listen and Learn. I don't dwell in a world of whether things are right or wrong as much...they just are.",1687238664.0

Flash banged and her children were there for when she was pushed face down and arrested. They were there for it all. I then told her that was her addiction. Addiction to the power selling drugs gave you. Addicted to the lifestyle. Addiction comes in many forms. You can be addicted to Benadryl and it still counts.

She says she needs “normalcy“ so badly that I try to cover up how I’m feeling to give her normalcy.

Nobody came in on a hot streak because they were just crushing it. And one thing I remember when I speak at new meetings is remembering that everyone in here at one point or another, was a huge disappointment. It's like my junky/ drunk version of imagine everyone is in their underwear. I still try to hide how I'm feeling from my wife, but I'm getting better at saying things when they come up. I still have very machismo versions of how men should act stuck in my head even though that thinking almost killed me. I've met many people who thought the same way and we talk about how being vulnerable and expressing how we feel is where true strength lies. I believe I was attracted to my wife because she had a normal life, and a supportive family. Deep down I wanted that. I thrived in chaos but I hated who I was becoming and I didn't want to carry on that tradition. I still dont use a calendar and I'm late to lots of things but that's just me.

Most of the ppl I talk to are still using. I love them but it’s rough to have those relationships. It’s just on the phone they are friends from college, living pretty far away. I moved to the mountains away from my plugs close to where I went to school. So kind of avoidant personality. I don’t have any current friends locally. I think I wanted to prove to my girl that I was so strong and I didn’t need anything but her and myself. Like “I’m not an addict, I got this”. Obviously not working and I am. She says she craves stability from me so I act like I don’t have an issue to prove to her I don’t. As you’ve probably noticed from my earlier comments, I feel like I’m trying to be more than I am right now. I feel down, malaise, and terrible cravings. I cannot act on them because I moved away from the dealers. It would be nice to talk to some people about this and learn some coping strategies and Have someone to talk to that’s been there.

jop84pr,"It’s closer to 40-60% but you’re right that it’s a high number and I’ve seen many people go back out. I’ve also seen many more come back in. I don’t fantasize that I’ll walk this tightrope perfectly and I’m just as likely to relapse as anyone. But I work on the tools to get me back if I fall and the statistics of relapse have nothing to do with how I feel today. I’ve actually never looked them up until right now. If you’re well connected and have a sponsor and take commitments people will call you and get you back if you slip. I know people who said their sponsor would blow up their spot in drug dens after they relapse and check up on them for as long as it takes. I’ve also seen people with decades of sobriety drunk at a meeting and they weren’t kicked out immediately. People waited til after the meeting and stayed with him. One of my best friends in the program had about a year and is a serial relapser but he seemed pretty determined. He had a brief slip and it was obvious and friends rallied around him to help him and he’s back and better than ever now. It’s progress not perfection. I need real people in real life. Reddit can be a decent tool but I need to be around people who walk the walk. I don’t think it’s surprising that most people here only talk the talk. And I could be one of them! You never know. But I can smell a drink on someone from across the room and I can immediately tell if someone is on drugs. I had to swallow that pill that it’s ridiculously obvious despite having believed I had em all fooled. The only way you’ll know for sure is if you try. I’d say about 90% of the stuff I do to stay sober isn’t stuff I thought about on my own nor is it easy or familiar. It’s about getting out of my comfort zone, out of me head, and trying something different. I already know how to isolate and get my bullshit signed off on. I know many people in AA that have drugs as their primary problem. My sponsor is one of them. It doesn’t matter, it’s the same shit in my book. Some people just prefer the vibe and the work at AA. And I’ve been to countless NA meetings. I have good friends that run a meeting nearby and they’re like my family too. I know for a fact that if I showed up drunk or started to isolate or slurred my words on a phone call there would be different factions of people surrounding my house and blowing up my phone to get me help.

joozt6j,"The program does not really encourage dating early on in recovery due to the triggering effects relationship issues can have on addicts, I also wanna touch on the fact that even tho we might all have time under our belts as sober, we will always be addicts. With that being said, if anyone here says they didn’t miss being high in the beginning of their sobriety, they’re lying. Even now with almost 4 years clean under my belt, when times get tough or when something very triggering happens, my first thought is usually about how much better sometimes life was when I was on drugs. Would I return? Hell no Early in sobriety i used to express the same thoughts and emotions to my partner and friends, and it helps honestly. Cause I could sit here and let those thoughts linger until I use again, or I can share that I miss doing drugs and hear some sort of support in the moment even if it’s not what I really wanna hear. The truth is, whatever the reason he’s decided to get clean, is working. He used to live in that “home” for a long time, he’s decided to work on building a new one for x reason. And I think it’s normal to feel homesick, addicts don’t just become great at coping and moving through life perfectly after completing 12 step programs, it’s a life long process. We wake up everyday and make that choice, it’s not something that is inherently in us to just do. And honestly as an addict, If he truly wanted to use there isn’t an overdose or drug charge that’s strong enough to stop an addict from doing what he knows best. But the fact of the matter is that he’s doing it, and he really needs to do it for himself, to save himself. Not do it for you, because you’re here now but that doesn’t mean you might be here forever. His foundations have to be rooted in all personal struggles that brought him to this point in his life. If you’re going to be going back and forth and questioning things and stressing each other out then I’m Ngl that can hinder his sobriety entirely. You can’t ask a bunch of strangers what we think is best for you, that’s a choice you have to make, my partner had a lot of things he had to deal with in our relationship. We’re married now expecting our first baby, but it was a long road to get to this point. That’s a choice you make for yourself and your own mental health.",1687175795.0
joof33f,"There’s many factors that led to my abuse of substances, but I definitely enjoyed being high. A lot in fact. Remember that addiction is a progressive disease. It starts out as fun, as we begin to face consequences it becomes fun with problems, and in the end it’s only problems. I’ve been sober a couple years now and work a program in AA. Those thoughts you mentioned come up once in a blue moon for me, but they’ve become fewer and farther between. Here’s how I look at it when I’m vulnerable: do I miss getting drunk and high? Yes. Do I miss the consequences of getting drunk and high? No. If I were to drink and use again, what would happen? I would lose everything of value in my life, simply because of the way I drink and use and the affect it produces in me. Do I wish I weren’t an addict? That’s a very complicated question, and ultimately moot. I’m grateful to be in recovery, I’m grateful to be surrounded by people in recovery, and I’m grateful to be alive. A little over two years ago I did not feel this way. I’m a firm believer that it doesn’t matter what brings an addict/ alcoholic into the rooms of recovery if they’re able to stay and hear the message, do the work, get sober, and maintain it. I got sober because I was backed into a corner and had no other options. I’ve stayed sober because there’s been a shift in me on a spiritual level that would’ve been unattainable had I not had the support of program. Addiction is often referred to as a disease of perception. Newly sober people have a lot to learn about how to live. I can’t speak for your partner but I was selfish, stupid, and literally psychotic when I first got sober. My mind was opened and I continue to learn how to exist with this disease. There is always hope for addicts if we stay humble, willing, and open minded. If it comes up again, or if you feel like talking about it tell him it’s worrying you. Try to help him play out the tape if you can. Ask what would happen if he were to pick up. Remind him that it’s not an option if he’s going to stay alive. Point out the changes you’ve noticed. I remember my dad telling me I sounded more peaceful sober and that affected me. He isn’t as worried about me sober and that gets me emotional still. At the end of the day what happens will happen. All you can do is witness it and take care of yourself. Relapse is part of recovery for a lot of people and early sobriety is wildly unpredictable. Wish you both the best. Tl,dr: the progression of the disease, hope, playing out the tape, setting boundaries.",1687158935.0
jooery7,"I have days where I feel like this. It's not the craziest thing to express those feelings. Hopefully this isn't his mindset all of the time. Things could easily get out of control if feelings such as those go unchecked for too long. I will say it's a pretty common way to feel in the beginning of recovery when you haven't settled into sobriety and made the choice to never go back. Unfortunately, most people have to learn the hard way that there are no half measures. Myself included. You either commit completely or find yourself right back where you started. Almost sounds like he needs somebody to talk to who can relate and understand how he's feeling before he acts on those thoughts. A sponsor of sorts, although I hate that word. A friend even. But probably someone who has been through what he has been through. Quite an honest thing to say though. It's likely that he really trusts you and felt comfortable enough to express his feelings to you. If that is the case, you could always help remind him why a sober life is worth living. Especially if he really likes you. Next time he says this make a comment or let him know that you could never stick around with someone who was actively using and only going to break your heart or eventually die. That doesn't have to mean you don't care about him or have feelings for him still. Just remember that it's not your responsibility to keep him sober. If it begins to feel that way, then you need to consider moving on before you get your heart broken, or worse, fall in love with someone who's going to eventually die and leave you hurt in ways you don't deserve. You have to put yourself first and look out for your best interest. Sometimes that's the best thing you can do for someone you love... Just being honest.

Some new ones, some I do now without simply being an excuse to drink/drug. Building/airbrushing gundam models, woodworking, volunteering, exercising and fishing are my top five. Ambition though? This is a struggle. Something I'm working on in therapy. I like to do the things listed above. I'm somewhat sporadic with them however. I'm not sure how ""ambitious"" I am with any one in particular. I stick with them because they help. They help keep the ""wheels from spinning"" as much as they would otherwise. At my core I think I just might prefer a simple life. There's a fine line between being content and complacently however. I'm also constantly working at keeping myself from ""comparing my insides to other people's outsides"". It makes being content with ""simple"" difficult sometimes. Social media is not a great thing for me at the moment. Being involved with communities can be draining but it's often the most rewarding things I experience At the end of the day my sober life may be difficult at times. Seemingly unfulfilling.

That’s all the more reason you need to be careful to avoid triggering an episode. We have to put our mental health first. It’s too fragile not to. Whether he (or you, for that matter) even realizes it, he’s manipulating and controlling you by telling you that if you hurt him he’ll probably use. He’s right, he probably will, but that’s his decision, not yours. His sobriety is out of your control. I had an idea, and I don’t know if this will work for you two or not, but it would kind of be a compromise between the finality of staying together or ending it. What if you two took a break for a little while to give him time to focus on his recovery. It would also give you a transition period if you decide that ending it is the right thing to do. It could look however you wanted it to and just take the pressure off. If you want to hang out during this time, you could. If you want space, you could have that too. If you guys want to see other people, anything you both agree to is ok.

jom1vk2,"Yes, some will accommodate this. I went to rehab at 30, worked throughout it, relapsed about six months later. I got sober when I admitted myself in-patient a second time. I’m a business-owner so stepping away for any amount of time was always a barrier. But ultimately, I basically parked my business for 10 weeks. Then, still in-patient, I developed a schedule (with help) that would gradually (and more moderately) reintroduce my work life. That was about 5.5 years ago.

jolym15,"Those are nice things to do as a couple but what are you doing for yourself? If you don’t feel anything at a sunset and are unable to find happiness for yourself then I think that’s easy to read. If I can’t receive or maintain happiness or live then I sure as shit can’t give it out. I think it’s normal to have some numbness in early recovery as it takes time for the feelings to come back. I spent a lifetime numbed out and I feel like I’ve been to hell and back. The last feeling I want right now is numbness. I had to unpack some shit, let go of some other shit, ask for help, say thank you, listen and all that other happy shit in order to dig for the roots and as gruesome as it may be, I feel like I’m on the right track. There was a time when I felt too much harm had been done in my relationship to continue but things worked out. I got to a point where I could say and believe that I will be ok no matter what. I love my wife and family but that’s not why I’m sober right now. I do it for me and I’ve put my sobriety at the top of the list. I’m no good to them if I’m it sober. If I can’t take care of myself, I have no shot at caring for them. I truly enjoy the work tho and I do something every day and I’m free.

Sometimes, it helps if I internally give her “permission” to be angry or upset for what I deem a ridiculous reason, and if she’s dead set on being miserable for a little while, than who am I to stand in her way? After all, there are days I, myself am determined to wallow in self-pity, judge everyone around me, and engage in all sorts of ridiculous thoughts… so I “allow” her the same latitude.

It took practice and suggestions that were not my idea to listen without getting defensive. Over time we both worked on our own recovery. My wife hated the idea of alanon at first. I was the alcoholic/ addict, why should she go? But she stuck around and it continues to benefit us both. It’s not just our relationship, it’s all of them. I don’t believe it works if only one of us is seeking support and doing the work. I’m involved in recovery communities and I show up. I learned to shut and listen and I became willing to take suggestions and find my role in all of my resentments. That doesn’t go unnoticed. My wife and I were going through a rough latch recently and it’s not surprise as we’re both busy as fuck and there’s some stress that is out of our control. Things were said and instead of bottling it up and plotting my revenge, we talked.

jocstki,"Well you have to admit that it is true that long term recovery rates are simply extremely low, and that’s not a dig against recovery programs, it’s just a fact that humans have not found a “cure” for addiction. As I’m sure you well know, kicking an addiction is not for the faint of heart. You can’t just brush off the fact that recovery rates are extremely low, it means we should keep searching for better solutions than what we have now. I haven’t been to a refuge meeting but I go to a recovery dharma meeting each week. Sounds like you had a bad experience with them, I haven’t found anyone to be pretentious at all in my meeting. Each individual meeting for each program is different and shouldn’t be used to define an entire program. I’ve been to some 12 step meetings that suck ass and others that are amazing. I’m sure the same goes for recovery dharma (which came out of refuge after the leader of refuge was cancelled). Perhaps the Christian shit is inconsequential for you, and for me I usually just ignored it too. But the invocation of Christianity does result in a similar energy as the church, and for myself and many people I know it is simply a turn off. It’s a turn off because the church has had a harmful impact on many people’s lives. I prefer meetings where I don’t feel that I can share my unfiltered thoughts, and I have never been able to do that at 12 step meetings. I have been able to do it elsewhere without much trouble. Again, if 12 step is a good fit for you personally, good. It’s not a good fit for everyone and it’s not a one size fits all approach to recovery. It’s just not. In my subjective experience, 12 step made my recovery much more difficult than it needed to be, and other programs strengthened my recovery and helped me to improve my life drastically by comparison. What truly matters at the end of the day is that people in recovery find a healthy community that they connect with.",1686926173.0
jocsb3r,"Please read what I wrote again. You missed the entire point of my post. I’ll try to clear. We’ve been together ten years. My addiction started three years ago. Before I started recovering, I held the negative core belief that I was not worth support, commitment follow through, and general interest in my life. While not overt, those beliefs hold power. Now that I have started working to heal those negative core beliefs and realize what I deserve… I’m left wondering if my husband thought I didn’t deserve those things either or it was just a generally not thinking it was an issue, based on the behavior I allowed to continue because I had no boundaries. I am in no way expecting him to give his 100% when he doesn’t have 100% to give. I am in no way blaming him for my addiction. I feel like Carrie going to the dance, it’s okay if I don’t like me because others do. Then oh wait they don’t and there’s pigs blood on me. I am simply asking if anyone has ever had this feeling.

jocd16d,"A couple of things, I guess. I know step programs don't/can't offer medical advice, but I wish they encouraged people to pursue a more well-rounded means of recovery. Therapy, the correct medications, understanding comorbidity, and slowly changing/adding habits were essential to helping me recover. Therapy helped me change how I speak to myself, how my trauma has affected me, and how to recognize what I need when I have a physical or involuntary reaction to outside stress. I have found it easier to stay sober when I can step back and calmly try to reason with stress responses instead of letting them overwhelm me. Medications have helped me because I also deal with depression, anxiety, and ADHD (heyyyy the Holy Trinity of bad brain 😅) While I know they can't recommend medications, and not everyone wants to pursue pharmaceutical treatment. However, sometimes your brain just isn't your friend, and that's okay. You don't need to just use willpower to steamroll through mental health issues. With comorbidity, it just helps to understand the relationship between addiction and other health factors like anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc. There is also a strong correlation between ADHD and SUD because ADHD leads to a lack of dopamine, so those with ADHD often (consciously or unconsciously) try to self medicate with substances. In some cases, necessary medications (like the one I take for ADHD) are controlled substances, but as long as they're used correctly, they can be very beneficial. (I know this isn't a good idea for everyone, but using medications correctly shouldn't be stigmatized) Lifestyle changes are often discussed, but how to go about them is not as much. It can be hard when you expect things to change drastically overnight because you're sober now, right? Then it's easy to wind up frustrated when you finally look at all of the damage that's happened because of addiction and realize there's a fuck ton of work to be done. It's easy to say ""clean house"", but even literally trying to just do that can seem like an enormous task. I found it to be much more helpful to do one small thing at a time. Do one cleaning task, make your bed, text one person, but try to add things back in gradually and do them consistently. When I try and do too much all at once, it's overwhelming, and I get burnt out. Then, I get disappointed, which can lead to a negative emotion spiral where I end up feeling that all of the work I've done amounts to nothing. I guess there's some overlap between stepwork and the things that have helped me, and some of the things that have helped me might hurt others' journey in recovery. I don't know. Oh! Also, the Pink Elephant Principle. When you tell someone not to think about a pink elephant, that's all they can think about. Well, step programs just seemed like a constant reminder of the fact that I have struggled with substance abuse. I am fully aware of that, and I just didn't find being reminded helpful. Something about living in the past 🤷‍♀️ Sorry for the long reply 😅 I do still have a few meetings that I've been to and enjoyed, so I'll always keep those as an option if the day comes when I need one, just in case.",1686918601.0

joafmtu,"Have you actually looked at the stats regarding success rate based on whether people go to meetings or not? There is not a statistically significant difference in long-term sobriety between people, with the intention of abstinence, who go to meetings and who don’t go to meetings. Same goes for success in long term sobriety when comparing 12 step programs to other recovery programs. Success rate of long term sobriety (5+ years) is roughly 14% across the board, whether you’re in 12 step, an alternative program, or no program at all. I agree that it can’t be done without willpower alone though. I imagine the people in long term recovery who don’t go to meetings do a good job of leaning into their support system and taking good care of themselves. And AA doesn’t explicitly state anything about the Christian god, but the text does imply it. First of all, referring to God as capital G “God” and capital H “Him” points to the male god of the Abrahamic (Christian, Muslim, Jewish) religions. Also, it was written by 20th century Americans, so it was obviously written by Christian people and their bias shines through the text, ESPECIALLY in AA’s big book. It’s a product of its time and there’s nothing wrong with admitting that. Other programs, such as recovery dharma, believe that we have the power to transcend addiction within ourselves. The people I’ve met at dharma meetings are by no means self-centered relative to AA. People in that program are not in denial about needing community, support, and tools to help us in our recovery. Those are strongly encouraged. The program doesn’t motivate you to do it alone, rather that we have the power to transcend our addiction. I have honestly met more self righteous 12 steppers than people in recovery outside of 12 step. Not saying that’s you, if 12 Step works for you by all means keep at it.

Their suggestions were useless, corny and irresponsible religious pseudo-therapy. The rooms themselves were full of standoffish cliques and jam packed with nut jobs, hypocrites, fakers, sexual predators, holier-than-though narcissists and angry old-timers. The only people that seemed to be relatively doing well were the overfriendly, brainwashed cultists who had substituted their addiction to substances with an unhealthy attachment to the program. All that said, I got sober in a 12 step program. At the end, I had exhausted hundreds of my own plans for moderating or stopping; including working overnights, going back to school, finding new hobbies, giving people control of all my money, getting 2-3 jobs at a time, playing multiplayer video games, limiting certain substances, living with significant others, getting engaged, adopting pets, locking myself in a room, etc, etc, etc. I had gone to several detoxes and rehabs seeking therapy and obtained freedom from chemical dependence for a short while. I had consulted with many psychiatrists and psychologists and took every prescription that they said would help. I had been to many hospitals and sought help there when recovering from a run. None of those worked for me. At the end— I was homeless, broke and broken. The 12 steps were the only thing left. The last house on the block. I still thought all those things I had thought… but I stayed away from the people that were the obvious nut jobs, hypocrites and fakers… and instead gravitated towards the corny, brainwashed cultists. Not for any noble reasons, but these suckers would buy me food and give me coffee and smokes. They then presented one of the dumbest solutions I had ever heard—in the form of the 12 steps—to me. After some pondering, I did them (to the best of my ability) out of having no other solution I could think of other than suicide… and a whole lot of sheer spite. I applied myself 100% to every suggestion, step and piece of constructive advice. Not because I actually thought it would work, but mainly I was too chickenshit to kill myself and at least I could rub it in their stupid, smug faces when their precious “program” failed.

Singleness of purpose is there for a reason, when they tried to wear multiple hats and help more people with more problems they ended up booting addicts during the Rockefeller Laws. Bill didn’t want to do that shit, some others sure did but he saw they weren’t staying clean and it was diluting the AA message, it was detracting from identification for both the alcoholics and the addicts. Addicts can get clean there now and do but they have to cosplay as alcoholics - You trade identification for preference or what’s available to you where you are.

jnsvysq,"First, you should think about why you felt like taking yourself off subs like that was necessary. I have done it, and seen so many others, and it rarely ends well. Whether it is believing we're not really sober if we are on MAT(or any medicine), or that it's a crutch, or money, or whatever, it's not something we should decide on a whim. Buprenorphine has a 12-24 hour halflife and has much more success with a slow taper that's planned in advance with our psychiatrist and other treatment supports. Some in the 12-Step community think their opinions are important but the literature is very clear that seeking outside help is imperative, a sponsor isn't an authority on anything, and taking needed medication as prescribed by a doctor we are honest with is part of recovery. Yes, it's a crutch. But, if you break a leg you don't feel pressured to throw away your crutches while your leg is still in a cast. You use them to allow yourself to heal enough to walk on your own again, and advised by your doctor. That's how subs should be used as well. It's to give us time to rebuild our lives so that when we are getting off of it, we have some stability and supports that will keep us from going back out there. Regardless, it is up to you and I'm not judging, just sharing what I've experienced and seen over many years in recovery as well as working as a Peer Support with others in early recovery. As for relationships, they're difficult for the most healthy people much less those of us with substance use and mental health disorders. It's also important to remember that no matter how knowledgeable and supportive the partner, they've also been traumatized by seeing our addiction and are going through as many emotions and stages as you are trying to get clean. I was a chronic relapser, so people in my life were wary everytime I got a couple months sober. I felt like I was doing great and they should be happy about it, but they're afraid all that would be different in a week. They're typically right. It takes time and consistency for them to feel safe that this time is different. Taking them out is nice for sure, but not with the expectation this will magically fix the past, that takes patience and work. Try and assume that what they're saying and doing comes from a place of fear and hurt, and that the best way to fix that is being understanding and validating their feelings and using your actions to show this time is different. Most importantly, I suggest couples therapy. So many people wait until it's the last resort before a breakup before trying it and it's usually too late by that point, so doing it now will be much more helpful. And if they aren't open to couples therapy right now you need to go on your own because they can still give you advice on changes you can make which is ultimately what you're responsible for. You have to make changes within yourself and hope the other person comes along. If you're like me, I didn't know how to be vulnerable or how to respond to someone being vulnerable with me. I would shut down or leave when she was upset which always made it worse. I justified it as taking a timeout so I didn't get angry but eventually I had to grow beyond the bare minimum and address why I got so angry at their hurt, why I couldn't validate their feelings, why I couldn't be honest about my own fears, insecurities, guilt and shame, etc. I wouldn't have the life I have today without therapy. 12-steps with a sponsor got me my foundation of recovery, but I have had shitty sponsors in the past that thought all of life's answers came from the big book as interpreted by them. And I trusted them despite their 3rd divorce being in progress because that's what I thought was the only way. Once I realized it's just one addict helping another and that I had many more issues than dope(and those issues caused my addiction), I was able to start working through grief and trauma with professionals and finally found some peace in life. I also don't think it's possible to do this independently, and definitely not desirable. No matter how much you thought you hid it, or how little you think you're affecting them, I promise you it's not the case. 21 years is a long-time to be with someone, that's awesome you've made that work and it's obvious you care for each other after that long! But, that also means they've been profoundly affected by your addiction as much as you have. They'll have their own traumas and fears and even the same readjustment period you are having. I'm not sure what you mean by them being impatient, but if it's in regards to your words or actions I can say from experience those don't magically change after PAWS is over. I can also say unfortunately it can take up to 5 years for all of the healing and rewiring our brain is capable of to occur. So while the most noticeable symptoms might be gone at 3 months to a year, the healing is an ongoing process. And again, if you're like me there's so much more than just using dope that I needed to deal with. Once people in my life saw I was putting in work, and doing more than I had any previous attempt, they really believed this time was different. Being vulnerable with them also helped them trust me more and I noticed I was given more patience and understanding because I had given them patience and understanding as well. Please don't read any of this as an attack on you. I am basing this off my own experience since I don't have all the details of your own situation. If it don't apply, let it fly. But hopefully you can find something in there that is relevant to your life and maybe helps you in your recovery, just as being given the info helped me on mine.",1686504219.0
jnsuqri,"The reality is that some people struggle with the fact that others’ experience does not match up with their own. No one can really determine what’s best for you, but you. Others speak from experience but that is just their own. I will offer my experience as some perspective, because I understand both sides. I got sober at 22 and started going to AA because of alcohol. I really hadn’t experimented with much else, so I was your good ol fashioned person with a drinking problem. I built friendships and felt community around me and stayed sober, found joy and freedom in life, but after about 6 years it really felt like most around me in meetings were just regurgitating the same things others said. It didn’t feel authentic or genuine to my experience and I drifted away from the program. I stayed sober for a while but started to research psychedelics and found myself very interested in how the could continue my spiritual journey so I made the conscious decision to give them a try (it was life-changing). In 2020 a few months into the pandemic, I decided to try cannabis. I was struggling like many others with the insanity around us and have always been opposed (for just me personally) to trying antidepressants or other pharmaceutical solutions, but needed something to dull the stress and anxiety of existence at that time. I eased into becoming a daily user but found that use of any of this substances never mimicked my use of alcohol. Personally, I found these substances help me address my feelings, process them, and find perspective on my current state, as opposed to covering it up or avoiding it (which is what I did with alcohol). Did cannabis help me unwind after a stressful day, too? Absolutely. Did it make doing the dishes a thought experiment instead of a boring chore? Yep. But I also understand that my sobriety from any substances helped me get to this place. I’m not saying that’s what you have to do. But I am saying that there is a benefit to being deprived of your usual devices for dealing with yourself and overall existence and having to sit in that. Not just sit in it but move through it and come out better on the other side. Sharpen the tools to help you not only cope but thrive through life on life’s terms. Substances can be a crutch but really, anything can. I’m grateful my experience unfolded the way it did, and I still feel god along with me each step of the way. Now I’m pregnant and completely sober (even from caffeine for the most part 😵‍💫) and I can’t say I miss weed aside from having to deal with constant nausea and lack of appetite, as well as missing a peaceful nights sleep. It’s unlikely I’ll ever be a daily user again, and It’s been nearly 11 years since I drank alcohol (I don’t generally use the term sober anymore but rather free from alcohol) the desire has not reared its ugly head and I’m grateful for that. I’m grateful to not be in fear of it returning at this time. This is only my experience that I share, but I hope it’s helpful to you in your journey.",1686503708.0

I always kept my mouth shut about suboxone out of fear of judgement based on past experiences with folks who rigidly follow the steps.

jnsiz72,"Being an alcoholic isn’t necessarily about consequences (or really even alcohol at all)… though those are what drove me to get sober. I’d hazard a guess that many people don’t really even know what quantifies someone an alcoholic, but it’s really quite simple. It merely is: “If, when you honestly want to, you find you cannot quit entirely, or if when drinking, you have little control over the amount you take, you are probably alcoholic.” That’s it. Furthermore, it helps to realize that alcohol was the solution to my problem, which is simply: My inability to perceive myself, the people around me, and my life as they truly are. If I can’t perceive things properly, I am incapable of reacting properly, so I will behave in an insane manner. Now, I never perceived demons in the bushes, or voices telling me crazy things… but it was rather a more subtle insanity. A delusional perception where life appears to only be this awful, miserable trudge of fear, anger, self-pity, victimization, unhappiness and hopelessness. That is my problem. The booze was a solution to that. Later on, it exacerbated the insanity and became a symptom. To that end, it was mainly my tolerance, dependence and biology that caused that solution to turn on me and utterly fail. I have always drank too much, and there were occasional blackouts and consequences, but none of those would have made me stop. It wasn’t until both the amounts I needed to maintain my solution and that I was physically able to consume in a short time, increased to such huge degree that everything fell apart. You can remove the alcohol, but that does nothing to fix the initial problem. When it comes down to any use of a mind-altering substance… be it caffeine, nicotine, marijuana or prescription drugs, they must be held to the same litmus test as booze itself so as to determine their potential for harm. I am chemically dependent on caffeine, but I don’t honestly want to stop, and more importantly, I can control the amount I take. If I were drinking so much caffeine that I was being hospitalized for heart murmurs or blowing my whole check on coffee and energy drinks, then it would be a problem… and smoking is a health problem, but it is far more subtle and less immediate than traditional drugs, and most people don’t get an honest desire to stop unless there is some type of consequence, but with smoking it’s usually too late by then. If you can say the same for weed, then the same applies. The danger in substances known mainly as recreational drugs is many people cannot. I don’t use caffeine or nicotine as a substitute for alcohol… but I spent a very long time trying to find other substances to replace or use in conjunction with alcohol to mitigate the consequences. Weed among them. I personally found that every substance used as such eventually led me back to the liquor store or found me drinking nearly the same amount, just with another substance tacked on. Obviously, this may not be the case for everyone, but many alcoholics have attempted the same in pursuit of another solution to their main problem or to supplement their drinking with substances in order to reduce the amounts and consequences. It’s a very slippery slope, but ultimately it boils down to why you’re using any substance and more importantly whether you can both control and enjoy it. I just try to remember that the solution is a spiritual experience and nothing more. We have a common direction to achieve one that works, but there are many individual paths which head that way. I just need to realize that sometimes your path can kill me, and mine you, as our footing is just as unique.",1686498726.0

If it does get bad enough and you’re getting worried please don’t hesitate to go to your closest emergency room- they can help with fluids as well - you’ll need to be honest with them that you’re in early recovery and what you’re recovering from. I am trying hard not to give any medical advice while still being helpful - I hope some of this helped.",1686423782.0
jno1exa,"I read your post. all i saw was someone that went back to trying to change the way they feel with substances when life got hard again. And for me a therapist isn't a part of my recovery program. They absolutely have a place, and some mental problems require medication, but for my addiction I talk to my sponsor and friends i made in the rooms. I take staying clean as a life or death thing so any medications I stay honest with people close to me about it so they can help check my motives. But like i said , end of the day its your sobriety. I've seen people in AA be ok with weed, and mushrooms etc , That just doesn't work for me . In my 21 years clean i spent way longer than 5 months dealing with worse things than mental neurosis, but guess what that's life. I'm not risking going back to the degradation of active alcoholism and addiction",1686410877.0

jnkm3yf,"Yes, and many of us also have survivor's guilt which is the same feeling you described but a double whammy. Low self-worth/esteem is also very common in people whom are addicted, and it doesn't easily go away. As others suggested, therapy is super beneficial along with mutual support in the form of 12-steps, an Outpatient treatment program, SMART, or whatever works for you. For me, helping others has been the best way to cope with low self worth along with shame and guilt from the past. Time also helps. You're living a new life and it's uncomfortable, even if it's objectively better than our old lives. Once we get some time and practice in our recovery selves, we feel more comfortable existing in our own skin. You're not alone!",1686340661.0

jnhdoyl,"(I’m not recommending this for everyone unless they’ve done extensive research and feel it’s right for them.) I was in recovery for 3 years, realized I had PMDD, sought a solution by utilizing DMT, and discovered that psychedelics can accelerate and facilitate profound introspection and change. DMT is very uncomfortable and it’s an ego dissolving journey. That’s why many people fear it’s intensity. It scares the hell out of people especially if they don’t want to know their darkest truths. That’s why some use it without prior inner work or a set intention or they demonize it. It’s not “getting high” or “escaping reality.” Rather, it amplifies the deepest parts of our psyche and brings it all to the surface like the most intense step 4. And personally, I needed that to be free of my suicidal ideation and self destructive compulsions. Now my external world and internal world are healthier and clearer than they’ve ever been. It’s all about self honesty and intention. There are many ways to recover. There’s no right or wrong way as long as that individual intuitively follows what they feel they need to live a life of freedom. No, there’s no magic pill that fixes everything. DMT is not magic. It’s what we do with those profound insights that matters. There’s still work to be done before and after. Understanding and consistent application are the keys to long term change. The 12 steps helped me develop a relationship with a higher power. The rooms gave me structure while I was still reorganizing my life and clearing the wreckage of my past. But the rooms don’t address mental health or severe cases of trauma. The “shut up, don’t trust yourself because you’re an addict, and just don’t use over it” ideology buries and diverts problems. It doesn’t help anyone lean into the truth. People have committed suicide in the rooms as a result of that ideology. In fact, I felt that it perpetuated a lot of issues for me even though I was religiously doing step work, sponsoring women, and going to meetings regularly. I will forever be grateful for the principles found in the steps, but 12 step meetings and the fellowship aren’t a part of my recovery anymore. I’m not saying they help many people live lives free of destructive drug use. I’m not saying they aren’t a good way to treat cravings and compulsions. They are. But I don’t regret changing paths, because it helped me realize that I can actually trust myself and I don’t have to fear going back to my old ways of being. I don’t have to fear my addiction being released and going out on a bender. I can respect and love myself today and feel my full range of emotions without fear. I have plenty of friends who overcame addiction and self destructive compulsions without a 12 step community. They just had people in their lives who believed in them. They say in the literature “to use is to die.” I feel like I had to “die” and come back. It’s made all the difference. So, for whoever needs to read this, don’t perpetuate a self fulfilling prophecy. Have the courage to change what you believe to be true about yourself. The drugs don’t kill us, but self hatred and lack of trust in ourselves kills us. Choose to love yourself instead.",1686279469.0

It was awkward at first, but I learned a lot from that and met a lot of people that I still know today. As far as finding a sponsor, just find that person that has what you want and ask them if they work with new people and would be willing to work with you, simple as that. Worst thing they can say is no.

Including stealing, lying, & cheating. Those things made me feel uncomfortable. So now in order to stay clean I have to open up to people who I don’t know but who appear to be living the life I am trying to live. I have to ask for help from people when I need it. The only one specific thing I can tell you that I did was I work just as hard at recovery as I did when I was using. It takes a lot of work to get high every day. I know how your feeling. I’ve been there. It’s hard and uncomfortable to try to live a life that I’ve never lived before. I had surrendered to the fact that I was a junkie and that is all I was ever going to be.

jn62a2m,"Hiya, thank you for sharing all of this. It really helps. A lot of people can't even get the strength to do this part, type on Reddit. Speaking in person is definitely a lot more difficult. But the cool thing about recovery programs is that almost every person in there has had that first initial problem: how do I start to mingle with this group? And the other great thing about most recovery programs is that almost every member is nice and friendly and forgiving: almost everyone. Sure, there are sick people out there, but ignore them and try again. So, next time, wait for a pause in the conversation, and say ""Hey, my name is ""Whatever"" If they ask if you are a newcomer, say no since you have been to meetings before. And just say, you are just starting to meet people. I always like to have a failure plan. If they ask me complicated stuff about the program, say you are attending meetings now and talking with your friends on the phone or something like that. If they get pushy about a sponsor, say the same thing, my friends on the phone and I have a plan. Thank you. Then change the topic. It is not dishonest to change the topic of any conversation. Start asking about the local club history. Or what other meeting time slots are like. Are the better attended? Do they have more old people, more young people? What about recovery activities in the area? What do people around here do for sober fun? Another great strategy when meeting new people, get them to talk about themselves. Hi my name is Whatever. What's your name? How long have you been coming here? Really? Cool. What's your story. Find an element of their story, ask about that. (Sorry to have typed so much.

jmxrk1z,"I currently have 13 years, but at around 18 months, I was borderline suicidal. It started with everything feeling like a grind, probably around the 16 month mark. Kinda a “same shit, different day” feeling that deepened as time passed. I was lonely and bored, but otherwise was doing everything I was supposed to do, and unsure why I was becoming more and more unhappy as time went on. I’d see everyone else seemingly having a grand old time, but I didn’t want to be around anyone, and would just isolate when I wasn’t working. I talked about it with other people, trying to find some sort of solution… and after a month or two, if one more person had said “this too shall pass” or “fake it till you make it” I would have punched someone in the face. It culminated one evening with me talking to a friend, rehashing how miserable I was, and in a fit of self-pity, I went into detail about a suicidal ideation I had been having, bordering on a plan. They threatened to Baker Act me and we got into a bit of a dispute… but the resolution was that I’d seek professional help. I ended up calling a few people and getting a reference to a therapist who would work with me on a sliding scale. Called him, and set up an appointment for the coming week and went to bed. I shit you not, I woke up the next morning totally fine. I distinctly remember thinking that maybe I didn’t need to follow through with the appointment, but I didn’t want to return to that misery, so I kept it. For me, I think I had been running my own recovery again. I had been asking for suggestions, but adding my own spin on things and ignoring those I didn’t feel like doing. The suggestion of therapy was one of those things I had dismissed outright (mostly for cost, and a little laziness), and it was only the prospect of having the cops sent to my house to commit me that I actually investigated it.

jm8wf2l,"I've also gone through shame about who I am, and feelings of being unloveable. To be honest - I think those feelings are quite common. It might just be that by learning how to think more clearly about how your actions feed into your anxiety that you can reduce your anxiety and your addictions. Have you looked at the ""This Naked Mind"" books? They've helped a lot of people. Essentially, addictions depend on a lie. We are addicted because we think that our ""drug"" is a source of joy. The reality is, it isn't. The only joy we gain from it is joy that we would otherwise gain from life. The reality is, that drug steals joy. It doesn't create it. For example, it's obvious that heroin is not a source of joy. Non-users aren't tempted by it. The same goes for anything you are addicted to. Once you recognize that the joy it gives is a lie, it is a lot easier to stop. It helps to celebrate any progress you make too. You can definitely do this. And that starts with not making things harder on yourself. ""Addictive personality"" is BS. There are people who are hurt and want a solution. Keep looking. You'll find ways to make things better. Those ideas helped me, and helped a lot of people stop smoking and drinking.",1685477459.0

jm38ing,"Your experience is valid. As a note, I don't go to AA. I go to NA. That distinction may not mean to you, but it's quite significant to me, as AA gives me much strong cult-vibes than NA. &#x200B; Regardless, here is how I see the 12 steps (without the g word). Since both my and your perspectives are valid, I feel it's only fair I share my view of the 12 steps as well. &#x200B; 1. I admit it: due to my drug use, my life is in shambles, and in this step, I see my life for how it is: a mess. 2. There is help out there. There are other people, communities, professionals that want to help, and have suggestions for me. To help me see myself and the world for what it really is (remove me from my insanity). And they WANT to help me. 3. I decide to take suggestions from others that know more than me. I take meaningful action and responsibility for my behavior. 4. I take a honest, hard look at myself. Why did I use? What behaviors continue to cause problems and are unhelpful to me? It's time for me to take an objective look at myself, my past, my shame, my fears, and my anger. 5. I let someone else into my life, and let them truly get to know me. I've pushed everyone out of my life due to my drug use, and I'm finally going to let someone in. 6. I become willing to grow because I see now how my behaviors affect myself, others, and my community. Seeing that my addictive behavior has had a negative destructive impact on all of the above, I become willing to change on a deeper level. 7. I swallow my pride, take more suggestions, and grow. I learn to be a better person from following the example of others I respect. 8. I acknowlege who and how I've cause others pain. My behaviors while using have affected other people. I know that now, and have grown and changed (from working the previous 7 steps). However, the people I've hurt in the past are still hurt. I list them to acknowledge exactly who and how I've caused pain. 9. I take responsibility for my part in my past behavior. I make an honest attempt to right my wrongs with the people I've affected from my past my addictive behaviors. 10. I'm still learning. I still make mistakes. I journal and reflect daily on how I behave, to catch myself when I start slipping back into addictive behaviors. 11. I can finally sit quietly with myself with acceptance. Knowing what is my part and what isn't (what I should and shouldn't take responsibility for), I can sit quietly with myself for the first time with acceptance and forgiveness for myself. I'm human, just like everyone else, and I can accept that now. 12. I help others. I share my experience with all the above, and give back to the community what was taught to me. &#x200B; There's no g-word above. Maybe that will help with the ""religious"" connotation. In practice, all these steps are what's practiced in therapy and self-reflection. Just in a structured, albeit intimidatingly spiritual way.",1685379003.0

jm1k8fp,"12 steps programs don't tell addicts they're weak, selfish, or idiots. They ask us to consider if our lives have become unmanageable (step 1), if there's constructive help outside ourselves (step 2), and whether we will decide to accept outside help (step 3). 12 step programs suggest that ultimately addicts should look to take suggestions from other people, professionals, higher power, groups, whatever. The purpose of 12 step programs is not to judge, ridicule, or insult. It's to provide a perspective to addicts that their view of reality is clouded by their consistent debilitating drug use. In practice, 12 step programs are not too different from CBT or group therapy. Of course, 12 step programs are not led by professionals, so take what you hear in them with a grain of salt. Ultimately though, 12 step programs are programs of love, acceptance, and faith.

jltw2zk,"Hey there, I was in your shoes once. I’m sorry you’re going through this, but I think the best thing is that you realize you’re struggling and you want help. The reason you only feel when you’re using is because you’re giving the addiction part of your brain too much power. You’re caving into cravings instead of seeking and building a life outside of drugs. You use it as a crutch on your bad days and you use your good days as an excuse to celebrate. There’s life outside of that. You just have to be committed to seeking it out. Replace your bad habits with good ones. Every time you want to cave, do something that’s good for you instead. Eventually you’ll build up the strength and confidence to fight your way out of your current state and your willpower will get stronger. You’re stronger than the addiction voice in your brain. Hell it took me months into my sobriety to even realize that there was a difference between my internal voice and my addiction voice… eventually I got really good at silencing the addiction… but it took time. It took reaching out for help and accepting that I couldn’t do it alone. It took cutting people out of my life who were enabling me and it took a lot of soul searching. I’m happy now. Financially stable. Have a great job, a car, a roof over my head, food in the fridge. I didn’t have all of that 3.5 years ago. You have to fight for the life you want to live and sometimes that means cutting out the shit that’s preventing you from getting there. You can have all of that. You CAN feel good again. You just have to ask yourself how bad you want it and don’t let anyone or anything get in your way.",1685200032.0

Just yesterday I was on a walk and the air was slightly colder than usual, every time I breathed in through my nose it kinda hurt a little bit. I know it’s from my party days… some things take longer to heal, some things you learn to live with but use it as a reminder of what never to do again. I have no cravings, no desire to use, and I’m generally a very happy person these days. I’m level headed, and people respect me for my choices. I work through my emotions instead of numbing them and I have a ton of hobbies… that being said, my past is just as real as my present… it happened. I struggled for a long time. I live with the consequences, but it doesn’t stop me from living a full life today. Good chance that the reason you slept so well in the beginning was because your body physically needed to heal and would shut down pretty easily. Now you have to heal your mental state. The anxiety you feel and your insomnia are likely your brain working overtime to heal residual emotional and psychological damage. Take it easy. Meditate. Go for walks, get some oxygen flowing into your brain, get some exercise… it will help tremendously. Remember that self care is a lifelong commitment, it doesn’t stop just because you think you’re healed. I’m still healing 3.5 years later if I’m being completely honest. I woke up crying this morning over shit that happened years ago… shook it off, and now I’m going to have a great day.

But generally a rock bottom occurs with most addicts and they continue to hide their use. If you are sincere in your desire to stop and will not conceal your habit after you seek help, telling your family should be simple and complicated. It may or may not be a surprise. Their knowledge of how to help with addiction may be minimal and they may need both yours and professional help to make it through. Until you stop it’s hard to predict what type of addict you are and how cooperative you will be with professionals and family. Cocaine is a highly addictive drug and typically takes help from more than just the user. Having a loving and supportive family can go along way. Be prepared for the need to educate them on what you need and your plan of action. Good luck.",1685075196.0
jlni70a,"Reading your post, I felt like I was reading something directly from 19-year-old me. I used drinking and Xanax to cope with stress, anxiety, depression, ptsd, and felt so disappointed in myself for what I was up to and how often I was doing it. But I thought I was in control of things and so I didn’t want to tell my partner or my family either because I was afraid of their disappointment and if they’d abandon me if I told the truth. But alcohol and Xanax led me to worse and worse vices in order to find some relief while I continued hiding what I was doing and lying to everyone I loved about it. But let me just say, that if I could go back and tell them what I was going through back then, been honest, and said I needed help, I’d give almost anything if I could go back and fix things. Because today, I’m 33 and I learned the hard way that I couldn’t do it alone & the people I was lying to were either aware of what I was doing the whole time and were heartbroken I kept lying or were heartbroken when they finally found out on their own. Your partner will probably be happier in the long run if you’re honest with them now and they can help you instead of possibly losing you than they will be if something happens to you & they find out that way or they find out later that you’ve been hiding that from them. I’ve pushed most of my family away at this point because of this very thing & almost lost my partner of 10 years when I had a seizure and she found out at the hospital that I had been hiding my drug use from them for years. Unburden yourself & be honest if you can because I promise you it’ll be much harder when you’re years into this, head underwater & the guilt is eating you up. It’ll start to feel like a cancer that you’ll only have to bury with something more numbing. Apologies on the length of this, but I really felt for you when I read this and if I can even just give you something to think about here, I’d be happy I did. I was in college too & got to grad school when it finally almost killed me & I lost almost everything — I got kicked out of school, I lost my job, lost my friends, almost lost my partner, and almost lost my life here but after it came out, I realized that my partner and those who cared about me would help me carry that weight I’d had on my shoulders. They helped me through it and I’ve been sober since that day. Good luck to you, hon",1685069856.0

Good habits include good thinking habits (maybe most important, but exercise will make positive think so much easier). One thing I forgot to mention that seemed so tiny at the time but I think really helped me get the ball rolling a few months ago: I tend to really get down on myself, call myself a failure, a POS, etc. and I slowly made a habit of catching myself in those moments, pausing, take a deep breathe in and say to myself “breathe in, my friend”, and then out “breathe out, my friend”. It seems like nothing, but what happened was I was planting seeds for a little self kindness.

You didn’t mention in your post OP, but if you don’t physically exercise, that’s the number one thing you need to do. Trust me, as someone who’s incredibly lazy and who naturally hates the idea of exercise, it will change your life. Start with daily walks for a week or so, solidify that routine, and then I’d highly recommend checking out r/bodyweightfitness if you, like me, refuse to go to the gym. All it takes is one hour, three days a week of LIGHT exercise. 3 months ago, I was depressed to the point of not leaving bed, I weighed 130lbs (as a 6’3” man) and I was borderline suicidal. And constantly stoned. Today, I’m back up to 175lbs, in the best shape of my life, so much more energy, I found a job, I’m ACTUALLY MAKING music again rather than staring at the computer and eventually giving up in frustration. I smoke weed occassionally. I took antidepressants for years, and while they made me less stuck, there were seriously problematic side-effects for me. Exercise is the last thing I naturally want to do, and it’s the first thing I should be doing. After a couple of weeks you’ll get past your internal resistance and start to reap the benefits. Look at it this way: you’re suffering greatly right now. No matter what you decide to do, you’re going to suffer, but you can choose to do the same things and find yourself in the same place a couple of months from now, or you can choose to invest your time and effort now, and suffer in the right direction. One option your future self will hate you for, and the other your future self will be so thankful for.

It took me until I was almost 30 to really grasp the fact that I had a problem with pot I smoked a lot and had negative health side effects I did try and eat them mostly healthy diet and thank God but I still had health problems. I discovered that weed is the slowest moving addiction. Many of the same symptoms of addiction from other drugs and alcohol are still there they just happen slower. So we know you're intelligent and like you said you're not motivated and that's probably due to the fact that it's extremely common when you stop using any substance marijuana included that it makes you go through some sort of withdraw and having depression like symptoms and loss of motivation is something that does happen to a lot of people maybe talk to a psychiatrist about for a short while getting on a medication until you can get back on your feet it's not a cure but it certainly could help and we could be a tool in your toolbox.

All of us are dying relatively soon if you look at the big picture. Weed has barely any withdrawals. Try going as long as you can without it and keep increasing that length. Your first day not smoking you might just not sleep or eat very well but you will be better the next day or the day after. Also, getting a job is the first step and will absolutely help with all your other issues.

Surprisingly enough most people I know grow out of video games. I’m a bit older (32) but gaming was huge when I was growing up, however most people stopped playing a lot in high school. We’d still occasionally play for an hour but then we’d go out or play sports in the yard. And I’d only play alone Saturday and Sunday mornings. My generation didn’t really have smart phones at that time. iPhones had just come out and weren’t that great. But get the job, don’t worry about the weed. The only way you grow is making yourself uncomfortable and surviving those situations. Most people are very kind in person, especially in the work place. They will want to get to know you and what you like to do. You will know if you guys will end up talking about weed and gaming. I’m sure there are plenty like you out there . There are 1 million delivery jobs right now and they don’t drug test for weed. At least in Massachusetts. Go on indeed and search jobs within 5-10 miles of your location.

Being on say .25mg of Klonopin is not going to be bad, it will mainly be in your head which is anxiety. I recommend monitoring blood pressure and pulse, but you would reduce by a tiny bit every few weeks. You can use a razor blade to cut down the pills and you can toss the small cuts into apple sauce because dealing with halfing these small pills is a pain. Moral of the story don't use for more than two weeks as you won't get dependent, if you get dependent super slow taper and it won't be bad. You do a fast taper it is gonna suck. You cold turkey you better just go to the hospital. They will give you Phenobarbital. And then you have to find a way to deal with your anxiety. Hydroxyzine can help with anxiety. Clonidine is also good for anxiety. You just have to talk to your doctor on dosing. Either way listen to your body, don't over think things, monitor your vitals (blood pressure cuff), and you want your BP to be good and your pulse to be under 100.

jlacrch,">I have begged and pleaded with him to get sober and find some mental help for his manic depression but he is terrified of doctors and needles and refuses to go to the hospital to detox It's not possible to say a person has ""manic depression"" when they're also drunk all of the time - that implies that the drug doesn't really do anything, and that you can judge a brain that is constantly blackout drunk in exactly the same way as you can judge a sober brain. He has one problem - his drinking. You also have that problem, let's not kid ourselves - it's very likely that the interaction between alcohol and your brain is why you formed the belief that you should live in a relationship with an alcoholic: dopaminergic drugs cause you to repeat patterns of thought that justify more drug use (and that happens to everyone who uses them, not just ""addicts""). I'm sure you want to leave, and yet I cannot help but notice you haven't. Wanting to leave and then drowning the feeling with alcohol is likely your cycle, and each time you do it the dopaminergic effect of the alcohol makes you more likely to want to leave and yet also more likely NOT to leave because you simply drown the feeling away with alcohol. >I'm scared of what's gonna happen to him when i leave and I'm scared of what's gonna happen when I tell him I'm not coming back. Again, see the influence of the alcohol - the outcome you're afraid of is already happening. He could already die doing what he's doing, and he's already completely non-functional. There is, objectively, nothing to be lost and everything to be gained in either scenario. But of course, if you leave you won't be able to drink to ""cope"" whilst saying ""I'm not as bad as him"" - you might not intuitively feel it, for the dopaminergic action of the drug only gives you the sense that you want to leave, but that's the real reason you're in the relationship.",1684848067.0

Plus some only respond to one class (nonstimulants, methylphenidates/ritalins, and/or amphetamines/adderall/vyvanse type meds). I’d also recommend looking into decreasing your dose. Too high of a dose can worsen adhd. Troubling part is sticking to the lower dose. But if you’re able to, 5mgs of short acting adderall tends to give the benefits without so many side effects.

jkxig5v,"are you taking any prescribed medications? a surprising amount can cause weight gain - most antidepressants, most anti anxiety meds, DEFINITELY antipsychotics / mood stabilizers such as Zyprexa (Olanzapine), Seroquel (quetipine), risperidone (risperidal), latuda, and many others. Also alternative medications used such as gabapentin / neurontin and pregabalin / lyrica can cause weight gain as well. If no meds - try a Keto diet, and also have your thyroid checked. Also, i’m not sure if you’ve looked into it, but they have a medication called Wellbutrin that helps treat depression and it’s not associated with weight gain like other antidepressants are. In fact, it causes weight loss in some people. Generally, people who preferred using uppers do better with wellbutrin over traditional antidepressants bcz it raises the neurotransmitters commonly associated with stimulant use (dopamine, adrenaline) - but in a much weaker way. It’s not even classified by the FDA as a stimulant; it’s considered a nonstimulant.

jkmj3q6,">I have always suffered from intense comedowns (probably because I have underlying depression & anxiety already) and had the worst I’ve ever experience yesterday evening Literally, everyone who has taken cocaine more than once recently experiences this - the problem isn't your mind, it's the drug. I'd recommend this - don't go looking for ""underlying psychological reasons"". This perspective implies that drugs are ultimately harmless, and that it's merely the addict who has a problem with controlling themselves, due to pre-existing psychological problems. This is as far from accurate as it gets - the true relationship is the other way around: drugs fundamentally hijack the belief-forming part of the brain. The beliefs that cause you to use, they did not exist before you took the drug: the drug caused you to form those beliefs, even if they developed from beliefs you already possessed (as all beliefs do). >I’m currently on SSRIs but am hoping she can prescribe something to help me get through this. So cocaine is an SSRI - far more potent than any SSRI you've been prescribed. The influence of the SSRI you were prescribed will be like the influence of a person taking a piss on the ocean on the world's sea levels. That doesn't mean you stop, and the average doctor won't know what to do about that, but the assumptions about brain chemistry that underly the prescription of SSRIs cannot be true in your brain: you need to give your doctor all of the information you have, including that you are constantly on cocaine, so that they can assess whether you should even be on the SSRIs (sometimes serotonin symptom is a complication of people who take cocaine also taking SSRIs). >An in-patient treatment option is unfortunately not an option for me as I am a single mom with a 4/yo daughter. I don’t have a relationship with my family and as great as my support system is, they work full time and have families of their own, so asking them for help for an extended period of time wouldn’t work. See the influence of the drug: having a 4-year-old daughter wasn't an excuse not to use cocaine, but it is an excuse not to seek help. This is backwards - you need to be prepared to ask your family for help. Right now you're banking that, in lieu of any external change beyond a loss of money, you're going to be able to control a habit you've thus-far not been able to control. In all likelihood you won't - it's very likely that you'll need to stay with family and have them care for your daughter whilst you get free of the drug. The total time to be free from stimulants and alcohol is normally a month or two before you're back to something resembling normal functioning: they're forgiving. You could stay with them for a month to detox. Ruling that out as an option is planning to use again. I had to do this when I quit everything (which included at-least 2 grams of cocaine a day). Being out of your home, away from your normal contacts and with other people taking care of the important things in your life is a good way to do it.

jkjrf9s,That’s a tough one especially where your both users. If your committed to quitting I think you should talk about having sex. My spouse and I schedule at least one evening a weak for intimacy. The exhilaration you feel while high and having sex is probably not what you will find with sex based on intimacy. Keep your expectations managed and talk about what you both like and dislike. It’s ok to say what you would like instead of waiting for your partner to do it. Talk in detail about fetishes and romance. You might even try porn together. I think the thing to realize is your traveling a new path of sexuality. My partner never liked our sexual encounters when I was using. He liked to snuggle and caressing. Which is very different than sex while high. Hopefully you can build a new intimate sex life that you find is different but has some promising sides. Don’t be shy about talking about fantasy and desires. Initially you may need to plan a date night and possibly plan what types of things you may do. Porn can sometimes stimulate one’s drive or even give you ideas. I hope this helps.,1684356177.0

Your experiences are valid and I think that you should ultimately be very proud of being 2 months clean. It is very good that PAWS is not affecting you every day, when I came off of 2M2B I had such incredible rebound anxiety, every day was restless and “feeling of impending doom” despite even being on an SSRI… I got through it by guided meditations and L-theanine. No one can do this alone though. I recommend you enter a support system of some kind, whether it’s as easy as therapy or as intense as AA. I think psychiatry is an important part of staying clean, especially at first, it will help you tremendously to try some non-addictive meds even if it’s just a seroquel for insomnia, they can help your mental health a lot There is truth to be found in submitting to a higher power and humbling yourself and admitting that none of us are perfect, all of us need help of some kind and there’s nothing wrong with that",1684340498.0

jkhwxgo,"I think you were asking for advice, OP. My advice is that you are trying to manage your health which is a positive thing. But you are also micromanaging your medications. You need to get really honest at a minimum a qualified physician who knows you personally to manage how the medication will go. It may also be the wrong medication for your various conditions. You also need to cultivate a relationship with a pharmacist to help communicate with your doctor about symptoms, side effects, and unwanted effects, etc. Being in recovery is a huge change and it will take awhile to figure out what are the correct doses of everything to manage your various conditions. This requires honesty and open communication. It may also require some patience and commitment to locate the best psychiatrist or physician to meet your needs. A final note is that I think you mentioned that you are studying to be a nurse. There are millions of medical professionals who are also in recovery from addiction and they do very well. However if you are out of recovery or are found to be a misusing medication then you have a serious risk of losing your license. That is sometimes fixable but it details your entire career at least for awhile, possibly forever. I strongly urge you to work with your medical team to get this under control. You are not in a position to be the one who decides what your dosing is or the schedule of when you take any meds.",1684330139.0

Internalize that, and meditate if able. Notebooks & pens; keeping a journal is especially useful when feeling anxious. Write the day at the top of each page to keep track of the journey. An iPod, or anything that doesn’t connect to the internet; they’ll probably take everything else away. Favorite chocolate or candy; take one bite each day and savor it… remember the simple pleasures in life. They make all the difference. Also, the sugar helps curb cravings from alcohol(if that’s your poison!). A few good books; readings with inward, spiritual focus were very helpful for me, but a nice escape is also great.

jkgys0z,"Person with ADHD here in long term recovery here. Is the medication prescribed by a physician and is it prescribed to you? Is there a clear notation on the bottle that has your name, the dose and when the medication should be taken? Are you taking it exactly as prescribed, including the amount, time of day and with or without food? It's not entirely clear from your post, although I have ADHD so I may have missed this lol. I am asking these questions because Adderall is a medication that is often abused or used in an off label way, particularly by students. I think if you answered ""no"" to any of the questions then you should immediately stop taking it and speak to your doctor. Also speak to your pharmacist if it is prescribed to you and describe the results you are getting. And actually, either way you should speak to your pharmacist about this. ADHD is a serious condition that appears to be quite common in people with addictions and in recovery. You will get a lot of different opinions about this. There are many people who think that ADHD drugs led us down a path of addiction. In my case I think it is potentially that seeking out self-medication and also untreated ADHD symptoms led us into problems with alcohol and other drugs. None of that really matters but it does matter that you seek out advice from your licensed medical care professionals and that you are fully honest with them about your situation, your behaviors both on and off of the drug, any interactions with other medications, the dosing and etc. Do not try to control the outcome by limiting important information. Also, what is your caffeine intake? As for me, I have taken Adderall before and it helped me a lot during graduate school and in other areas of my life. I do things differently now and I take a different combination of medications exactly as prescribed. It is literally like another whole job managing mental health and my ADHD and it needs to be taken seriously.

jkawevd,"Through my years of recovery and seeing peoples struggles, by far I would say healthy socialization. Those meetings are the only thing most of us do during a day where we have to talk to people outside of a professional settings. When we first come in, we don't know how to NOT speak to people about drugs and instead gear things towards a conversation about recovery. Or even just how to speak to someone new and get to know them like a normal person where you ask questions about them and genuinely create a connection. Personally, I combated this by forcing myself to go out to dinner after meetings. Sometimes it was 3 people, sometimes it was 15-20. But all of them were uncomfortable lol. I have several years clean and I still struggle to feel comfortable in social situations. It has gotten much better, but only by forcing myself to ""get comfortable with being uncomfortable"". The thing I find ""normal"" people think about parties/get togethers is ""Oh all the neighbors and more who I don't know will be there. This will be exciting!"" and they look forward to getting to know new people and have new fun. I find the average addict will feel that same excitement but mistake it for straight up fear. I noticed a distinct change in myself after I really got clean and started to examine my new behaviors. When I was younger, before I started using, I was a competitive skateboarder who toured the country doing contests. When I would be getting nervous, I could channel that energy consciously to make me more determined and I could feel a surge in my muscles as the moment drew closer. Again, I could channel that doubt, worry, and paranoia into motivation, more precise moments, and confidence. Then during/after my use, I started to suffer from severe anxiety issues. Now, when I get presented with an anxiety inducing situation, I feel little to no control over how I feel physically and mentally. I was actually agoraphobic for several years. I couldn't even go to my mailbox without collapsing on the ground and having to be picked up by an ambulance. This ties back into my mention from before. I don't think addicts freshly clean know how much damage or out of whack their parasympathetic nervous system is or are even aware that such a thing exists. I have since armed myself with education. That is what relaxes me. Knowing that mine is severely damaged doesn't upset me, it relaxes me. It helps me know that my feelings aren't one of conscious cowardice, but something semi out of control. Recognizing the social anxiety, educating myself on the what and why, and making changes through exposure therapy have helped more than anything. Sorry for the novel, but to me it was something worth explaining at length as it has been one of the biggest hurdles in recovery for me and I see it in 95% of the newcomers. It is one of the reasons why I actively approach newcomers and invite them out and offer to give them a ride and pay for whatever they want to get to help grease the wheels. Everyone needs friends.

jk9bqy8,"I think a better question to ask yourself is: why did you pick up a drink? That's the real issue. As others have said, it could be that you missed something in your step work. It could be that you have not accepted some fundamental beliefs. When I relapsed the first time, it was after I had a year sober. I had built up the importance of that date in my head with expectations but in reality, it was just another day. I was still depressed and in an empty marriage and still had all of the daily issues in my life. Drinking / not drinking did not fix that. Drinking just made it 100x worse. After spending a significant amount of time trying to figure out why, I came to the conclusion that I never believed in a higher power or learned helplessness or spirituality. I had to find what worked for me ; that made sense for me. And it wasn't saying prayers or 'coming to believe'. I found secular recovery meetings and a councilor that understood and helped. I never understood the whole counting days / go back and start over. If I'm on a journey, and I'm halfway there and realize I fucked up, I don't go back at start from the beginning.

How you felt, what happened, was there a tool missing in your tool belt, what you would do differently in retrospect. Then formulate your new plan for recovery (or tweak the old one) accordingly. For example, I was super reliant on the social aspect of AA: my small home group and my sponsor who was also my bestie. She passed away, I moved and couldn't find a similar tight group of friends in recovery and didn't click with the meetings in my new city. I started feeling depressed and my addictive voice piped in (I knew nothing about the AV back then) and I was not prepared and felt for it because in general I have a very quiet AV. When I made my new plan, I made a wide network of friends in recovery, I went back to AA but also explored different techniques and methods other than the steps including addictive voice recognition and urge surfing. I also got into mindfulness meditation which helped me a lot with anxiety. I redid the steps because it was a 6 years relapse and I had definitely more things to add to my 4th step.

jk84m3d,"Unfortunately what you experienced is the reality of dopaminergic drugs: in 12 years, a sober person would have long-since gotten over their mothers death, but because dopaminergic drugs force your brain to repeat the pattern of thought that led to their use, then your use of them in response to thoughts of your mother's death guaranteed that the thought pattern ""my mother's death is terrible and pressing"" would have been force to repeat: that is why you are still feeling negative emotions so long after the event itself. Each time you used, the feeling would have become stronger. That's what so many people fail to comprehend about dopaminergic drugs - whatever problem you think you're using them to ""help"" with, they're actually causing. Even though you subjectively experience it as ""trauma"" and say ""this isn't due to my drug use"", that simply isn't how drugs work: if you used to ""cope"" with your upbringing and then your mother's death, the drugs necessarily were enhancing those feelings to the point of being the most pressing thing on your mind: it isn't possible to take them and not experience this effect.",1684149601.0

It's not how you intended it, but it is reality. Even if I grant you that your wife is ""humiliating"" you, if you choose to respond to humiliation by becoming a drug addict, that is 0% her fault: she can only choose to treat you a certain way, how you choose to respond to her actions is caused 100% by you and 0% by anyone else. You could have chosen to respond to that humiliation by refusing toa accept it, by demanding an apology, by leaving - by any other path that didn't involve drugs, but you instead used it as an excuse to use drugs.

jk1x30s,"It sounds to me like, if she, knowing that you're an alcoholic, was drinking with you and had no problem with your actions or anything else in your relationship, that her having an issue with you going to treatment is because she may enjoy the relationship that you had when you were just covering up your problem, and now that you want to do something about it, she is being intentionally unsupportive. I'm working on a few key assumptions here... 1. I'll assume everything you're saying is true, to the letter, so if anything was a bit of a stretch or left out, take all of this with a spoonful of salt, or maybe just throw it out 2. It's very odd that she apparently had no issue with your drinking, with your marital life, financial situation, love life, etc. but when you decided to hang out with some friends she didn't like, it started a fight, you admitted you had been having problems with your drinking and decided to go to treatment for it, and all of a sudden she wants a divorce 3. It sounds to me like, if she, knowing that you're an alcoholic, was drinking with you and had no problem with your actions or anything else in your relationship, that her having an issue with you going to treatment is because she may enjoy the relationship that you had when you were just covering up your problem, and now that you want to do something about it, she is totally unsupportived; this is extremely toxic to your sobriety and it will not last if that is the status quo in your relationship, her cosigning your drinking but no your recovery 4. If what you said is true, and you left nothing and, and there were no other marital issues, I would say she may be bluffing to sabotage you in order to get you to relapse and/or leave treatment, so she can keep you sick/the way you were Keep in mind, I'm a 29 year old recovering heroin addict who only has 10 months clean and just broke up with my first love a year and a half ago, but it was over similar circumstances, she didn't use drugs before we got together, and when I told her I had a problem(because I wanted support), she said sh wanted to get high with me. After that point, all of my attempts to get her to be supportive of my quitting failed, and she even had a tweaker she randomly met try to kidnap her one night because she me this random dude and got in his car to do drugs with him because I wasn't willing to give her anymore, Obviously alcohol is different, but really, it's not.Again, if what you said is true, you and your wife have had a great 8-9 months and a lot of that relationship seems to be predicated on drinking. Your wife may be an early stage alcoholic herself, and this might be her way of trying to sabotage your recovery in order to keep what she already has with you. If this is the case, I can only say, you need to pick you recovery. Only time will tell; if she is legitimately concerned about your recovery, then all you can do is the next right thing, staying lean, working through your counseling, and trying to work through all the issues and influences on your life that lead to your drinking in the first place.If you complete this process, work on yourself, and just strive to be the best version of yourself, she will likely come around, and if she doesn't then you've still got yourself and you'll be strong enough to handle anything that comes your way, with the help of your tools, support network, and higher power(if you have one) For now trust that she means what she says, and take a wait and see approach; see if she continues contacting you, tries to make up, maybe even tries to create another catastrophe in order to get you to relapse? First and foremost, you have to look out for yourself. Finally, if any of this resonates with you, I implore you to run it by your counselor before your really internalize it so that you can get a legitimate professional opinion on the matter, because I really don't want to fuck up your head with some delusion. Your story just resonated with me and mirrored my last relationship and first love a lot, and I felt like I should say something. It could also very well be that she isn't an alcoholic at all and just has serious issues with the idea of her husband being in a treatment facility, it may make her feel like she can't explain it to her daughter, etc. Again, just food for thought.",1684017937.0
jk1r988,"Let me be frank here. The ones that give hot stone massages and do beach walks and then take you to pet horses are garbage. Each day there's either an insane amount of free time or no free time because you're too busy finding your chakra or some other B's and not working on real recovery. Get in somewhere and just make it happen. Very few places have doctors on staff. The doctor will come in maybe a few days a week and you have to make an appointment with him a week or so out. Just the way things swing. You need somewhere that helps you reflect and grow. Not somewhere that pampers you and tries to make you forget. Because the second you walk out those doors, you're left with only you to do the right next thing. And if you haven't done some work on yourself in those 30, 60, 90 days etc, you simply won't stay clean on the outside. Get in there, detox that shit out, and then get to working on yourself.

jk12pn6,">I understand her urgency and frustration, she’s not wrong, but she takes my addiction as something that I’m doing to her and not something that I have no power over. Excuse me - this is an absurd and selfish mentality, not to mention a debased and petty use of the 12-steps to justify your bad conduct. At the time you chose to use, you weren't under the influence of any drug - you had almost half a decade sober. Despite that, you chose to use, you chose to lie about it, and you only told the truth when she rumbled you. You gave every indication that you cannot be trusted, and that you were happy to both commit the most intimate type of betrayal. Instead of dumping you, she helped you. That is her treating you as though you're not your addiction. What does she get as thanks for that incredibly kind and caring conduct? She gets you blaming her for your addiction. Look at this crap.... >I get where’s she coming from but she has a way of making me feel so ashamed that would rather continue to self destruct than to look at her and ask for help. Blaming your wife for your own choices - ""it's her fault I choose to do this"". You should be ashamed. You betrayed her, and you were stone cold sober when you decided to do it. You should be ashamed of the fact that you did that to her and all she did to you was arranged to get you help. >We used to talk about setbacks and milestones nearly daily and it used to help. Eventually it came to a point where anything that was upsetting to me wasn’t as important as her issues, and the anger she had with employees was aimed at me and what I failed to do for her. Horse. Crap. The only person who has poisoned you with drugs is you. You're the one finding excuses to use, she's the one urgently driving you to rehab. The only person who has attacked and sabotaged you is you. She has done everything in her power to help you, despite you working actively against her. >I know that it’s very important to go as soon as possible but I also know that I would be extremely resentful for being forced while hungry and tired. You're not getting it - you betrayed her, and now you're not showing any urgency, in fact you're actively blaming her for the fact you need to go. She is not forcing you to rehab - you are forcing yourself there by relapsing. She has nothing to do with it - she doesn't want you to go to rehab. She wanted you to be honest with her, and to not use because you know the harm it would do to her and the inconvenience it would cause. Instead, you decided to go to rehab - you decided to stop doing it yourself and to start betraying her and abusing drugs again. Now you won't even go immediately to get it fixed - you're actually placing your own hurt feelings above hers.",1684003935.0

jjy41xq,"Hi internet friend! I'm not sure if it's fully applicable to your situation, but what I've learned is that there will always be people, places, and things that will trigger our instincts to run away (aka turn to our poisons). It usually means something needs to change, externally or internally. I was relapsing a lot when I looked outward into all the ways people, places, and things are destabilising me, until I got fed up and decided to be my own pillar and advocate for happiness and based my choices around that. Discipline can sometimes be the highest form of self-love. And it really pays off. Not just for you, but for those in your sphere of influence.. like your daughter's. You have great clarity and insight into your stressors so take whatever steps that is in your power or bandwidth to reduce your own suffering (example open communication with your partner). Some things and people are beyond our control or take time to change so we need to priorities our peace of mind and work towards being less reactive, keeping our ultimate goal of sobriety as the key vehicle to our journey towards well-being and wholeness. Sure reality is always going to be imperfect, but we need to accept and work on it (which includes inner work) One trick I use on my mind is whenever the slightest notion of wanting to use starts brewing (usually because of something unpleasant in life or in myself) I use metonymy to replace my drug of choice with negative words like unhappiness and then ask myself.. ""Do I really want to take more unhappiness?"" It really frames using as ultimately detrimental to my life. Anyway I feel very much for you and your post, so I hope at least some of what I've said would help you in some way. Rooting for you. (Sorry for any typos)",1683941584.0

Then I had a mental break down, got diagnosed with PTSD, OCD, and severe depression, and accepted help for them. Eventually I stopped taking the SSRI, because I didn't need it anymore. If you haven't tried it, it may be worth to do some research into success stories. Another great way to boost endorphins and other feel good chemicals in your brain while it heals is exercise. Changing up your daily schedule can help, too. I started taking walks, going to parks, small things at first. Then started forcing myself to go to an outside mall.

During addiction, we cover up so many illnesses (both physical and mental) and we're forced to come to terms with them afterward.

jjbhm67,">I guess that thinking really doesn't make sense because regardless of the behavior or the substance if you're using it to cope you're dependent on it and that's the issue And more subtly than that, those drugs make you believe you need to cope. That's what dopaminergic drugs do - they quite literally force you to believe whatever is needed to justify taking more of the drug. Most people don't reach this level of understanding, and they think the drugs were just a ""coping mechanism"", never comprehending that the very belief that something needs to be ""coped with"" was also put there by the drug. >Frankly, I get that God isn't for everyone but if you logic isn't something that I feel alone could help me with my problem Remember, logic is just ""correct inferences"". If god existed, he'd also be subject to logic. >Because faith is a believe without evidence The problem with that is that you cannot believe one thing without evidence without believing the other. Believing that the drugs which have so far done nothing but hurt you will somehow ""help"" next time is belief without evidence - if you train yourself to believe one thing without evidence you're training yourself to believe all of the other things without evidence. As soon as you accept ""god"" exists, then god is responsible for your choices and not yours. If you ""turn your life over to god"" and then you take a bunch of drugs, suddenly it's not your fault it's ""god's"". People wrap-up blaming god in the language of self-blame, they say ""I didn't give myself over to god enough"", but this is just ""it's god's fault I'm not sober"" in another package. True, enduring sobriety requires absolute accountability - that's about the antithesis of the mentality of all that ""god"" crap.",1683541170.0

jj9x7nu,Here's a quick story that might help: I bought a 300$ watch that I love a few weeks ago. Last week I thought my roommate stole it. Couldn't find it anywhere for another week or so. The moment I realized it was gone it dawned on me that I had a choice to make. Sure I could be pissed at my roommate and sulk but I know from my history in recovery AS WELL AS from my big book(resentment is the number 1 offender aka number 1 reason for relapse) that being angry raises my stress level and when my stress level is elevated I naturally want relief. Well the stress reliever I have the most experience with is drugs and alcohol. So while there's no guarantee that I will drink if I get angry there is an undeniable record of me doing just that. So I chose to focus on the positive things in my life(10 months sober and on the deans list) as opposed to the missing watch. It also dawned on me that I spent a whole lot more than 300$ (approx 60k from 2020-7/2022) on my addiction so how important is this 300$ watch? I concluded that it was not important enough to ruin my day and put my sobriety on the crap table. I also decided to practice some forgiveness with my roommate. After making that decision I was happy. Truly happy. I am finally handling difficult situations like an adult. Oh yeah.....I found the watch!,1683504365.0

jj7g25p,">I'm actually ruining my life with a drug that's supposed to be hard to ruin your life with. I really do feel sad when I see this sentiment expressed, because it's so far from the reality: the only thing weed won't ruin is your body. Won't ruin your body directly, of course - almost everyone I know who uses weed has consumed junk food to the point that they're obese: that's a perfectly fine definition of ""ruining a body"" in my book. Weed is a dopaminergic drug - this means that, with regards to your mind, it does the exact same type of damage as every other addictive drug. It directly hijacks your brain and makes it form whatever belief it needs to form to justify getting stoned, which is normally the belief that you're besieged by stress. Whatever the primary non-dopaminergic effect of such a drug is, the secondary effect makes you believe situations are occurring that make you need it: cocaine users believe they need to speed up, weed users believe they need to slow down, DMT users believe they need spiritual enlightenment etc etc. You are caught in this trap - you feel you need perpetual numbing. The belief that the world s full of things that require you to ""cope"" by getting high is the damage the drug has done, the false beliefs it has induced you to form that make it almost impossible to rejoin relaity. It is a perverted and gormless population that calls that fundamental attack on the faculty of wellbeing ""harmless"". I'm glad you've found NA. Whilst it wasn't for me, I am open to the help it can offer people. What I will suggest is that God has helped a dubious quantity of people, whereas logic helps everyone: the answers about drugs are in the science of how drugs work, and if you want a dose of that to work alongside your god, I'd recommend the book ""Molecule of More"" by Lieberman and Long, which goes into great detail about the underlying mechanics of drug addiction.",1683465341.0

You need to be Open-minded to the program, even if you think it might not work for you, or that you don’t agree with it. You need to be Willing to do what it takes to stay clean — and that might just mean giving the program a try and giving it your all, even if you don’t agree with the views or steps. Don’t worry about how you approach the steps yet. Find a sponsor when you’re out in meetings. Preferably someone with some clean time, a good understanding of the steps, and the same gender as you. A sponsor will guide you through steps, and be able to share their experience, strength, and hope with you. The spirituality part is hard at first for a lot of people. I still don’t really have a “higher power” either. But for now, I AM thinking of the group when they said God. Group Of Druggies. They are a power greater than myself, because I can’t do it alone, but I can with their help. It’s just a little easier to start there, not looking at it spiritually but more of as a supportive group more powerful than myself on my own. NA is a simple, spiritual, NON-RELIGIOUS program. remember that last part for sure. Even if you’re put off by the program at first, keep coming back.

My thought with it is that the drugs are the urgent issue, it’s not good to overeat long term but it’s a huge step down from substance abuse. Your digestive system adapts to what you give it, you’re going through a transition and hunger/fullness cues can be screwy. Rehab is a really good spot to get out of your comfort zone, does your place go to a gym or have equipment? When I’m really struggling to get back into it I make a deal with myself to do low impact cardio for just 5 minutes. If I feel okay I’ll go to 6 or 7. Just establishing the habit helps a lot, and it’s only 5 minutes today but maybe I can get to 15 soon. If there’s any staff or someone who works out regularly that you trust, I’m sure they would be happy to help figure out machines or whatever if you told them privately that you needed a little help getting back into it.

Some of that is also the nature of being a teen and not wanting to be told what to do, but I do think that teens see marijuana as ""not that bad"" when it actually can cause a lot of harm. But it is not different due to legalization. I was in high school way before it was legal, and it was just as rampant back then in teens as it is now. It's really hard for law enforcement to prevent something that most people can grow themselves without any special skills or knowledge or equipment. Or for people to catch on to it when it can be hidden in baked goods and other foods. Schools can't exactly ban food or test every kid's snacks and lunches. It was just as easily accessible for constant use when a kid brought laced brownies to school as it is now in its various forms and products. The only difference was that before it was legal, kids were buying their weed from dealers and sometimes getting unregulated products laced with much harder drugs. It can be hard to kick a weed addiction, but it's even harder to kick an accidental heroin addiction that you picked up when you thought you were just buying weed.

It was basically a big long meeting with a bunch of people who were court-ordered to be there. I’ve been to a few, I never got much out of it, and I got way more help at inpatient facilities than I’ve ever gotten at an outpatient one. Best of luck.",1683171459.0
jisebl5,"Fuck it, here it is copy/paste from the basic text: Atheists Recover Too I grew up without a teaching of god. My father, though raised in a very devout family, renounced all faith in the religion he had been taught. I too couldn’t believe that there was something out there that had some magical power to do the impossible—to defy the laws of physics. There were many things beyond my understanding, but to attribute them to a deity was, in my mind, just another way of avoiding the fear of the unknown. Too many people used god, or the devil, as it were, to deflect credit due or to avoid taking responsibility for their mistakes. I viewed the in- stitution of religion as a means of controlling the masses, and I didn’t want to be controlled. I made it my mission to refute this god in which other people believed and put their faith, but they resisted. In fact, in spite of all my efforts, I convinced not one person that they were wrong and that I was right. I just isolated myself all the more. So, when I got clean I was apprehensive, to say the least. How- ever, I was ready for a new way of life, so I just focused on today, and just for today I was on Step One. And there was no god in Step One. I got a sponsor who taught me about showing up and being dependable. He taught me about how to be available and not to be judgmental. He shared his experience and allowed me mine. The foundation of my recovery was laid in our relation- ship. I wanted what he had and was beginning to get it. We moved on to Step Two, and it was time to cross the god bridge. I went on a quest to find a power greater than myself. I stepped out of my comfort zone and sought out people of both conventional and unconventional religious faiths. I opened my mind to what worked for others. I questioned, I listened, and I practiced. My search brought me to a number of different spiritual and religious groups, but I didn’t find my place among any of them. What I was looking for was something quantifiable, something tangible to put on display—“See this? This is what I believe. This is the god of my understanding.” Maybe if I could find that god, recovery would be easier. But that’s not what I found. With no breakthroughs, feeling lost and dejected, I decided to approach Step Two another way. Perhaps the steps, the fellow- ship, service, and my sponsor would be enough to help me find recovery, without a god. Steps Three, Seven, and Eleven posed the greatest challenge because of their references to god and prayer. Steps Two and Six required some creative thinking as well. In practicing the Sec- ond Step, NA and the group became a power greater than me. By participating and being of service I was able to put the needs of the group and the suffering addict before my wants. My self- centeredness began to ease, and a restoration to sanity began to take place. I was right where I was supposed to be. I could see that my struggles weren’t in vain, even when times were hard. I was experiencing life and growing as a result. In the Third Step, I began turning my will and my life over to the process of recovery and to the spiritual principles that could be found in the steps. I was told to be honest about my belief, even if it was devoid of a god; otherwise the remaining steps would be of no value. I started to have faith in what recovery could offer me. With the strength and courage I found, I contin- ued with the rest of the steps. In Step Six, my defects of character were in the forefront of my mind. As I became more aware of their effects on my life, I tried to control my defects by suppressing them. The result was that they seemed to become worse, causing more harm, both to those close to me and to myself. I reached the place where I was entire- ly ready to be rid of my defects, and I moved on to Step Seven. Believing that humility was an important aspect of the Sev- enth Step, I went to others for their experience. By earnestly seeking the experience of others, including those with whom I had little in common, I was performing acts of humility. I en- deavored to live life by spiritual principles in order to relieve my shortcomings. Instead of merely trying to be rid of my shortcom- ings, I sought to replace them with something positive. Step Eleven was a bit of a conundrum. “I’m an atheist who be- lieves in the power of prayer,” I became known for saying. The statement, meant to shock people, became a conviction. Prayer wasn’t getting on my knees and petitioning a deity. Rather, it was how I lived. As a prayer, all my decisions became important and relevant, regardless of how insignificant they might seem on the surface. I saw meditation as a tool or exercise to help expand my awareness. It helped to put me in the moment and to maintain my presence of mind throughout the day. The result was a spiritual awakening, a realization that I could stay clean, work the steps, be an upstanding member of Narcot- ics Anonymous, have a life worth living, and carry a message of recovery. All this was possible without a god. My initial fear of not being able to stay clean because I could not “come to believe” in a god had passed. I now had proof that it was possible, and the proof was in how I lived. I have sponsored many people, some who struggle with be- lieving in god and others who have a firm religious faith. Those who struggle find that they are not alone and are accepted as they are. Those with strong faith find that they too can share openly with me, and their beliefs are welcomed and accepted. Either way, my sponsees and I have the opportunity to grow together. I trust that what they come to believe has the power to help them, and they have the same trust in what I have come to believe. Sometimes we disagree on the particulars, but the particulars aren’t what keep us clean. What keeps us clean is the choice that each of us makes not to pick up and to live this way of life to the best of our ability. This is a spiritual program, not a religious one. I try different approaches to working the steps. I still read and try to expand my knowledge on spiritual topics, and I constantly review my experience and contemplate its meaning in my life. This isn’t to say that I don’t question what I believe from time to time, or that I don’t struggle, because I do. Life isn’t always easy. Sometimes I feel alone during hard times. Believing in a god is alluring, be- cause I know others find comfort there, but I do not. Today I do have a spiritual solution, however. The steps provide me with a framework for applying spiritual principles. Service acts as a conduit to relieve my self-centered thinking. The fellowship re- minds me that I’m not alone, and my sponsor is a guide through the process. I continue to be a seeker. Anyone with a desire to stay clean can stay clean.",1683171341.0

jis6o0a,"Why do you say that? That was actually the suggestion, but my therapist helped advocate for me to be able to do IOP instead of inpatient. The main reason for this is because I am under the authoritarian control of my parents. I'm 22 and in college so they still support me financially. If my father knew I was a ""junkie"" as he would say, I wouldn't have a home to return to, nor would I get my student loans signed, have health insurance, etc. He's an alcoholic himself but has very disparaging views directed at drug addicts. Also part of the final decision was made today based on the fact that I went to the second part of my evaluation and said that I hadn't used opioids since Friday. For some reason, she didn't test me. I don't know why I said I hadn't used them since then since I have and am very transparent with professionals about my drug use, but some inclination told me to say I hadn't. I'm glad I didn't. If inpatient were the recommendation and I didn't go, I would be forced out of treatment with my therapist due to not adhering to treatment recommendations. I have other mental health issues that need to be addressed so I do need therapy outside of my addiction, and my therapist and I have a great rapport and is probably one of the coolest people I've ever met. He's also in recovery which is an added bonus for our relationship.",1683167419.0
jis42r7,"I have been on both sides of the desk in my life. My drug habit was so significant, I lived under a slide on a playground and thought that it was ok- very much an on fire but “this is fine” time of my life. I was a unmanageable IV heroin user and I am honestly shocked I didn’t die. But that’s another story for another day. I am now a program manager for a community residence for substance use and mental health for different levels of care. My best advice: plan nothing and let it happen. OP will be weekly one on one counseling sessions and a few groups a week plus submitting drug tests and maybe offering you various medications. It will be what you put into it, if you seriously want to change- let the process happen and help you. Try to keep an open mind to all suggestions and do your research. Inpatient is much different. Groups all day and intensive therapy one on one sessions. Very structured schedule. I went to about 16 rehabs before I “got it” and I’ll have 7 years in a few months. NA meetings are not for everyone and are not a cure all in my opinion. They help with this social aspect, but make sure you are listening for the message and don’t focus on the messenger. Take everything with a grain of salt & try not to get hung up on “God”. “God” can be your cup of coffee in the morning. Just think of it as something bigger than you, like the universe. At least that’s how I do it. On the worst days, do not give up. It will 100% be worth it.

I realized the change when I went to a friend's house to help him with a computer issue and was standing alone in his washroom next to a massive cannabis harvest that his wife was curing. I was over a year free from cannabis and maybe 4 months sober from alcohol at the time. Instantly, before I even had fully realized that it was cannabis, the devil on my shoulder was saying ""Take some and put it in your pocket. They won't even notice or care, there's so much."" but the head on my shoulders was genuinely confused. Not a bone in my body wanted to touch it, smell it, or even see it, much less steal it and smoke it. I genuinely felt nothing but confusion at these ideas that didn't even seem like they were originating from within my own head. I might as well have been standing in front of a pile of turnips. I don't even like turnips, why the fuck would I steal them? Then to double down, I was at my home group meeting a few days later and I shared the experience. Just laid it out there on the table. A few people thought I was making some kind of cry for help, that wasn't the case at all. I had never been honest about anything like that before, I was used to experiencing these dark impulses and either acting on them or denying them and keeping them buried inside of me as secrets.

You're locked in a room doing opioids and smoking weed - you are just doing drugs alone the same as before.

You're not going to stop the opiates - you're going to back on the coke. You'll tell yourself you need to go to work, or do one task or another, and you'll just do the coke for that but no more. Then soon you'll be saying ""well I was off it a week - there's more tasks that need doing. It's controlled now - I'll just take a bit more to help with the cleaning"". You'll know when you're going to stop, because you'll stop. Dead, and if that means severe withdrawal and feeling worse than you've ever felt in your life for months you'll do it, and you'll be glad you did it.

jik9ttm,"So whilst the NA narrative, and a lot of pop-psychology will say that drugs aren't really the cause of drug addiction, and that it's actually underlying psychological issues or trauma that cause people to use drugs, this narrative is a false one: it's tantamount to saying that drugs aren't really addictive or dangerous - it's just that some foolish people are too ill or feeble to enjoy them. But people can be forgiven for adopting it - it feels true. Drugs are dopaminergic, meaning that they hijack the part of your brain that is designed to form believes about the correct way to act: normally this part of your brain leads you to fulfill your social and material needs, forming beliefs consistent with these objectives, but when you're on drugs it will form whatever belief needs to form in order to make you take more drugs, because the stimulus causing the release of dopamine is the consumption of the drug. As a result, drug addicts are never addicted to the feeling of drugs (this quickly becomes unpleasant): they simply adopt patterns of thought that lead to the consumption of drugs. Because most drugs feel ""good"" (though their primary effect has nothing to do with dopamine), then most people who consume drugs form beliefs that mark them feel bad, which of course they then""deal"" with using the drug. From that person's perspective, they first felt terrible and the used the drug to cope. They quickly believe that their ""trauma"" is the reason they use, because it feels that way. But this is a false narrative - it's a symptom of the drug. In actuality, the consumption of the drug came first, and that induced the perception of one's situation or past as ""traumatic"", because of course this makes you take the drug to ""cope"". Look at your words here.... >I am trying my hardest now to not give up this time and build back my life now, but god this looks so tough and unachievable. I cant focus, Continuous negative thoughts which disturb my concentration. Deciding how much to push myself and where to draw balance. Tasks which were so easier to do earlier right now seems impossible, cant seem to retain most of the information. if i am not able to understand something or perform a particular task, i go into negative thought spiral. Also the impulses to run when things get hard or impulses to just slack off. these are only few to name. You think this is you. You believe that this is your nature, and you're using the drug to cope. It feels that way. This is not you - this is a symptom of the drugs you've been abusing. They induced you to believe negative things about yourself in response to frustration precisely because you then ""cope"" by using the drug. Unfortunately, drug beliefs are ""real"" beliefs - they need to be overturned, but they can only be overturned when you're abstinent from the drug. It generally takes months or years of being abstinent and actively reasoning against these beliefs to return to normal - but you will do it eventually, and the benefits are immediate, even if the start is very difficult. So, to answer your question... >If anyone of you experienced same things please suggest me that one Big factor, Things , thought, activity, daily routine, which helped you in your journey. You can share your own journeys too if it resembles mine. The simple answer is ""understand drugs"". If you are not reading a book on how the brain works with regards to drugs, I'd say you're losing precious recovery time - I'd recommend starting with ""The Naked Mind"" by Annie Grace and ""Molecule of More"" by Daniel Z. Lieberman and Michael E. Long. Once you actually know what they're doing to your brain, it's infinitely more difficult to fall back into negative patterns.",1683035542.0
jij9rtu,"26 was when I relapsed after over 2 years of sobriety. And drank for the next 2 years. Not fun. Eventually ended up alone everyday drinking in my bed because of “work from home.” I was SO SICK, alone and ugly at the end of this round. My body was not functioning and I wasn’t even drinking thaaaat much bc I was on naltrexone and my stomach lining was fucked. Withdrawal was a major bitch this time too. So you would think I would learn lol. 8 months (with some short drug relapses) later I still think I have PAWS. Like I’ll start randomly crying if I’m around alcohol for some reason. It’s been harder for me to stay sober too this time around. I don’t know why. My obsession and cravings are definitely stronger. But I can’t even imagine opioid addiction with the fent and tranq nowadays. I mean I’m not the best person for advice bc I’m clearly not in a great sobriety space, but you’re so young and have so much potential. My little brother is 25 and fucking his life up with drugs and alcohol. I told him it only goes down from here. Now that we’re not on lockdown there’s so much you can do. In person NA, AA, therapy. Start a career and hobbies you care about. Damn I should take my own advice. But I get it. Our minds fuck with us. Try the vivitrol shot once you detox? Naltrexone helped me a lot but I take the pill and you can stop it anytime so it’s not reliable. Hence how I relapsed. Delete the contacts of people you use with or cop from. Avoid any triggers (troublesome family, people, places) Like I moved into an apartment where I can’t walk to a beer, gas station, liquor store and that’s helped. I try not to go around my family bc they’re usually drinking and my brother has drugs in the house. A lot of childhood trauma there. I pray you can beat this and not look back. Man, I pray that for me too. I pray every day take the compulsion away and lead me on the right path. But I’m still resistant and that’s the problem. I heard a lead tonight from a girl who got sober at 26 and nows 11 years sober. And her situation was shit and now she loves her life and helps other people.

In fact, you could find the service now, and just touch base with a doctor, let them know you plan on doing this without any support but that you want to just have this option available in case it gets too bad. That way, you have a back up plan that is better than simply relapsing. If you want, I can help you find someone in your area.",1682922100.0

jibnyxv,"Quality trumps quantity. When viewed through the narrow lens of “time” alone, sobriety can appear to be unattainable, but perhaps more importantly, to have little or no value when it is new. This is not the case. I’ve picked back up at various points in my journey, 30 days, 1 week, a few days, several months, 9 months, etc. The times I picked back up after a week or so, I sometimes viewed it as “no big deal” because I had only made it a couple of days. The times I picked back up after an extended period, it made it harder to start up again, because all that time was “gone.” Both mindsets are delusional and a form of addict thinking. A part of your brain wants you to use, so you can’t believe the lies you tell yourself. You journey takes what it takes. For me, I needed those slip ups… especially those after many months, to demonstrate that I can’t safely use… even if I’m so far away from my last run that there is absolutely no chemical reliance, increased tolerance or latent biological craving at play. I needed to understand that simply not using, for me, is not enough. That left to my own devices, I will pick back up again eventually, and I didn’t know how not to do that. So, I needed an actual “program” of recovery, to work daily and/or weekly, to head off that inevitable slip up. Now, as to what that program might be for you, that is what it is. There’s many self-help programs… SMART, AA/NA, therapy, religion, psychiatry, rehabs, and many others. Try them in the order you find most palatable, but don’t discount any of them if one doesn’t work for you. I had to wind my way through 5-6 of them before I found my personal answer. And moreover, remember that time is only time. A simple measure of moments that came before. A tape measure may be absolutely necessary in order to build a house, but the quality of the materials used is just as or even more important to having a wonderful home to live in. Focus on that. Obviously, the quality of life at the beginning is going to be crap after a run, but that’s not so much due to what you’re doing today, but the aftershocks of yesterday. The longer the run, the more wreckage there will be. A tornado that touches down for a minute is horrible, but far less so than one that stretches on for miles. That is simply how absolutely destructive substances can be for addicts. They rob joy and and happiness from your future, so their presence is required to numb that realization. That misery you feel and those consequences that must be addressed when getting sober isn’t really from today or the future, but the destruction of today and tomorrow that the substance has already wrought. Drugs may appear to “heal the past” in order to allow me to enjoy the present, but they absolutely annihilate my future. And that piper must be paid if I am to live. I have 13 years sober. My life has grown beyond my wildest dreams. It is full, almost too full, with all the trappings of a good life, so my program has taken a back seat. I can assure you, that if you do everything you can and are willing to do everything that’s asked of you… within several months, you’ll likely have a better quality of sobriety than me with my 13 years. I see those fresh-eyed folks from time to time, and I envy them. Time is only time.",1682873135.0
jibii79,"A YEAR??? THAT IS AWESOME!!! GOOD JOB!⭐🥇You may have relapsed but you didn't lose the time that you were sober for. So think of it as a slip... Not a full blown relapse... It happens though.. Sometimes relapse is part of recovery but you don't have to stay stuck there... Pick yourself back up and if you need to call a Suboxone doctor (or check into Ophelia online -from what I've heard from numerous people you can get a 30 day Rx for subs) which will help you come off the opiates if you need tof . But there is always hope and the fact that you have a whole year under your belt goes to show that you can do it. Many people can't put 2 days together so be SO PROUD OF YOURSELF. It may help to sit down and make a list of all the reasons you want to be sober and post it somewhere where you can see it before bed and when you wake up. Also here's a list of online meetings if you want to check them out sometimes it helps to hear other people's successes. _HYPERLINK_ I never talked during them but they gave me some hope in the beginning. But I believe in you buddy. You can do this. You had a slip and that can happen to anyone. Don't beat yourself up, instead treat it as a learning experience.

Do you remember when you couldn't even go one single day without using, let alone put 2 days together; let alone get all that time under your belt??? You are a freaking star!!! ✨⭐ ✨🥇And you didn't lose that time just because you relapsed. But if you feel that you need long term rehab, it might be a good idea. The longer you are away from the drugs and the situation you were in while you were using, the better your chances are going to be of success, especially if you've been using for a long time. It takes our brains a while, 6 months to a year to really start getting back to normal off opiates...I see a ton of successes (including mine) with long term.

ji83u23,"The program laid out by 12 step groups is literally designed to get us ""unstuck"". Just like anything, it has it's flaws but as the common saying goes, ""it works if you work it"". I myself have a tendency to over analyze and there are plenty of things to get hung up on. These will drive people away. It sucks, it happens, it's no ones fault but it's always a shame. I'm just grateful I found someone early on who ""had what I wanted"". They told me to ""utilize, don't analyze"". It's exactly what I needed early on. Three years later I can afford to analyze a bunch of stuff. It takes effort to keep myself from feeling like things are ""all bullshit"" but if I keep at it, it makes my recovery stronger. I'll be very clear that I'm not a religious person and then say, early recovery takes faith. It's not the idea of faith in the conventional religious sense. It's admitting that we can't do this alone and that people (or ""things"") can and are willing to help us. Honestly I can't see why anyone would want to do it another way. Recovering alone sucks. Then we have to be willing to accept that help and follow advice. It's not perfect but it's simple. Above all, it works. A 12 step program isn't going to replace a psychiatrist but it will get you clean and sober. It will provide you with simple tools and resources to get through each day, one at a time. Before I got sober the idea of being sober for 12hrs was simply unthinkable. I literally couldn't do it alone. My experience started with rehab but AA taught me how to live without drugs, alcohol and being wrapped up in a negative mindspace. You can do this. Just one day at a time. You deserve it. Simply following the advice of others will keep you sober and life manageable. Once you get a little ""time"" seeing a therapist or psychiatrist becomes something wonderful and productive. I saw a therapist before I got sober and it was useless because I was using. Now I see one and it helps immensely.",1682800118.0

Whether that be SMART recovery, 12 step, or some other kind of constant support your best shot at getting clean will be something consistent. That said, 12 step isn't for everyone so you need to find something that works for you.

ji4j0aa,"Rehab/treatment is definitely a great place to start. You’ll have days where you wanna give up but stick with it, it teaches you new behaviors, gives you a routine and shows you how to live life without drugs. It’s a safe place to just check out of society for a bit and take care of yourself. Once you leave though, it is on you to continue utilizing those tools that they give you. For me when I left treatment, I moved into Oxford and it took about two or so months to get stimulated by anything like movies, shows, art and even reading books. For awhile I felt empty and bored once I was out of treatment, so it’s best to surround yourself with likeminded people that can help you stay accountable and stay busy. You’ll have a decent amount of time clean and you’ll still get urges but they won’t be as strong and they do pass after a short time and continue to pass shorter the longer you go. I’ve been clean for about 5 years now and I still sometimes get cravings but I just quickly change my thinking and distract myself with something else. Working helps too. I work 40+ hours a week, running a business and I have no time to really even think of using and those times where I do, I play the tape back and remember that if I were to use, my whole life would potentially implode and I know I would feel so bad after I used just to get a few hours of a high. Whatever you do while in treatment, try not to link up with anyone. Whether you’re attracted to the opposite sex or the same sex or whoever, just be weary of getting too close to someone in particular because while yes it’ll feel good to have someone but it will distract you from the bigger picture and potentially derail this whole investment. It’s best to go in with an open mind and take everything out of it that you can. I wish you the best! Treatment is really great to get the help you’re needing.",1682728351.0

jhznjt1,"That's a very real thing; like I said I've read tons of medical literature, and the main thing that got me into it was actually the history of bipolar in my family and the fact that I used to use Marijuana when I was a teen :) So what can happen with people who are susceptible is basically, Marijuana can lead to a ""Psychotic Break"", where a person will pick up a piece of delusional or magical thinking from a particularly moving experience with Marijuana, and they'll carry it into their regular life. Sometimes, just one really bad psychotic break can totally ruin a person, or some other times, a bunch of psychotic breaks can add up over time. At the very least, in susceptible people, marijuana tends to massively increase anxiety. A lot of people who have anxiety or other mental illness think that marijuana helps their symptoms because it \used to\ when they were children, but for a large number of people, marijuana's effects change after the brain has matured, which causes marijuana to cause a great deal more anxiety, but since some of those people have already become habituated to it and felt that it used to help their anxiety, they continue smoking weed thinking that it's helping their anxiety, when in reality it's the main thing causing it. Today, I'm in a place where I'll smoke weed every now and then, like a few times a year now mostly but a couple years ago I would do it on weekends, but I'll say, quitting smoking weed(and every other drug) between 20=26 totally changed my life for the better :) If you haven't taken a multi-year break from weed, I highly recommend it. You can always pick it back up later, and it might do you a ton of good. I used to suffer from Depression and Anxiety, but all of that totally went away after being clean for 6 years.

I just couldn’t see past the social aspect of it then - but everyone else has long since moved on or they’re deep into addiction like I was/have been in the past. There’s something to be said for meeting people in recovery with time instead of just hanging with people in your time-boat but it’s also nice to have peers who understand. However the people who are older and have more time will help you stay sober now. Would be nice if I could find a balance and actually make friends,1682622829.0

I still have the unhealthy habits of self loathing, laziness, isolation and lying.

Serious trauma there and it's hard to stay away from them.",1682621972.0
jhybzwy,"If your not done Or don’t believe being sober will be better for you then sadly you will just have to go get some more pain and misery. No one can make you stay sober or want it which is unfortunate but if you stay around people in recovery who are happily clean and sober then maybe you’ll want that to. (Attraction rather than promotion) is the only way I’ve known. Fellowship, sponsors, meetings, 12 steps, higher power, counselors, priest, preachers, favorite movie star, mom, dad, brother, sister NONE of those will help you if you aren’t willing to be HONEST, OPEN MINDED, or WILLING. You have to tell on your disease or it will keep you in bondage ! You have to be willing to try something different ! (If nothing changes THEN nothing changes) . You have to be HONEST or no one can help you because they don’t know where to start or how to help you…. I’ve been where you are and I know those 2 years probably sucked really bad and now you think sobriety is boring and pointless because you were “better” getting high but that’s because you made a decision everyday to keep it like that. 1.Did you do any service? I find the most healing in helping another addict or person in need 2. Did you pickup “HEALTHY” habits and hobbies? Or did you continue the same destructive behaviors and habits 3. Did you find something bigger than you? Or did you continue believing the world revolves around you? 4. Have you ever had some alone time and not depend on another person to make you feel happy or loved? Or did you keep getting into relationships because you can’t love yourself There is so much more to just staying abstinent from drugs, you have to change everything. I usually don’t write long messages like these but something is compelling me to do so.. I know your pain and struggle but I will tell you I get euphoria and spikes of dopamine everyday that drugs can’t measure to but it takes time getting there but you will start seeing the change gradually and that made me want to keep going, the world is big and you’ve been boxed in with your thinking.. If you make some changes and find some peace and love from within then I promise you will want to keep it and not cash it in for misery.. old people, places and things will make you relapse every-time or make you think substituting is ok. I’m rambling a little bit now but I can sense your anguish and confusion and I want everyone to get it and feel the way I do today because lord knows I never thought I’d feel the way I do sober, I have everything I wanted and more which is plenty of fun and euphoric moments and days",1682621104.0

I know I need to surrender, I just don't know how to get to that point. And I romanticize the whole concept of hitting rock bottom. It's like I need a better reason to remain sober.

jhy84h0,"> I’m obsessed with feeling like I need to hit a rock bottom like others have in AA or NA to truly know if I’m an addict. My impression of your story is that you qualify for a seat in either AA or NA. I am biased towards the latter because I have been going to NA meetings for 11 months. I have 2 years of experience with AA as well. In NA, the 'disease of addiction' itself is emphasized as the 'problem'; and the 12 Steps are the 'solution'. We are more comprehensive in NA through peer based treatment ""...therapeutic value of one addict helping another"". That is also happening in AA; but again, we deal with the whole 'disease' -not just one substance. In NA we consider alcohol to be a drug as well.",1682619592.0
jhy7h59,"1st I want to say nothing is wrong with how you feel, most addicts early in recovery are in the pre contemplation stage. Your still trying to decide if you want to be sober. 2nd You seem to have some poor mental health and bad self esteem so your judgment or choices right now are NOT going to be positive for you but detrimental. You are trying to run from your problems and poor choices in the past which is comfortable and easier for you. 3rd your past choices have made you miserable so I suggest you speak with a therapist or a woman who has some long term sobriety. Let someone help you make some choices but to even start recovery you will need to be BRUTALLY HONEST, OPEN MINDED, AND WILLING. 4th if you are even contemplating on getting sober then you have hit a bottom, stop comparing and look at the similarities.. it’s always a YET because if you keep on the path your on you will be doing everything you said you wouldn’t. I can guarantee it and it’ll be harder to face those problems so better get right now. 5th GOOD LUCK on trying to get sober on your own will and thinking, your thinking got you where you are now. Hopefully you find a higher power and come to terms that getting high or drunk is going to keep you from being the best you can be and keep peace and love far from you but misery and pain.

jhwlmf8,"You are doing the right thing. Alcoholism is the ultimate destroyer. You can't be a good partner if you are isolating, carrying on a secret relationship with alcohol. If it hasn't happened yet, know that addiction makes us grumpy, unstable, emotionally volatile, and all sorts of things that are unpleasant. The withdrawal is the most obvious bad part of it but there is a lot more going on that comes from it. You don't like being present in your life and feel you need it to have the courage to just do every day things. But, the longer you are sober, the easier it gets. You need to make a long term plan for how to live past the 1 month mark. Really analyze the way you felt when you relapsed. Write it all down or tell the story repeatedly until you have a clear understanding of the days leading up to your recent relapse. The mounting pressure of dysfunctional beliefs, the lack of any coping skills except drinking. The lack of a support network to really talk to someone when you start to spiral. You need someone who you WANT to turn to. Use reddit, but also start talking to people in recovery more. You need people that you sincerely check in with once and awhile. Say, Hi, how are you. And allow for those moments of what we call ""small talk"" with people around you. It sounds dumb, but it will help you in your sobriety to do this with everyone you have to talk to during the day. This way, when you hit a crisis moment, and you want to share and talk to someone, you have people who you've been talking to. So, if it is the front desk people, the other people in your detox, the nurses and group leaders and members, people at 12 step groups... all of these people- just greet and chat for a moment. That is a big part of your recovery defense system. Consider it pre-planning for when you will need to reach out. Even if some of these people you don't imagine you will see again, do it anyway. It's more important than I can describe. So, once you get through detox you might want to consider a sober living that is 3 months rather than just 30 days. Some sober living requires the 30 day program. Don't worry about your boyfriend. If he loves you, he will understand. But even if he doesn't, getting sober is your path right now. Love doesn't always have great timing. Getting sober is not an extra curricular activity. It's necessary for survival. And being in a new living arrangement 30 days sober doesn't sound like a good move to me. But you know yourself best. If living alone is not good, maybe it is better. Just understand that you could be very unpleasant and all your dysfunctional behaviors and beliefs will be on blast. You can do this, but you need a 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, ans 2 year plan.",1682593951.0
jhwfwsn,"Just because you aren’t where you think you should be at 36 doesn’t mean you can’t get there. Trust me. I was an enormous fuck up. I’ve burnt so many bridges, wasted opportunities, found myself in jail several times and eventually prison for almost 7 years. I’m 38 now, I had literally nothing and was in over 19k in debt just three years ago. I made drastic changes to my life, everything from drug use to nutrition, fitness, mental health and so on. I changed jobs, not just companies but went from welding in the IBEW to running a desert bar/cafe. I went from being homeless to housed, I went from being completely alone to having a few homies who are family now and tons of friends online all around the country and world. I went from being suicidal, depressed and hating myself to someone who doesn’t recoil in shame when they see their own reflection. None of these things came easy, no one could do these things for me. They could barely even help me do them myself but I gotta say my former inaction was way way more painful then the hardest days making changes. It’s cliche but I had to start small, baby steps as they say. I couldn’t go removing from addiction and depression without clearing some of the smaller hurdles on the way. Things like making food journals and dialing in my nutrition, diagnostic things, tryna figure out what even needed to change (in my case it was literally everything) I don’t even recognize the person I once was because we are just so different now. You can get a job TODAY, it doesn’t need to be a job you stay at the rest of your life. Just get SOMETHING. A job in a kitchen or bartending, barista whatever. If that’s not your style, changing oil or sweepin floors. Something low stress, will prob be low pay but let’s get real you need something to get outa bed for not just a paycheck. Even shit paying jobs can provide this and will be a step in the right direction towards getting back your gym membership.

jhoge0t,"I'm very sorry you lost your baby. The problem with being clean is that it requires that you don't want to destroy yourself. The risk to most recovering addicts is that they start thinking ""drugs will help me"", but in the case of you and your boyfriend I suspect you never thought that. You were both probably looking to hurt yourselves, so the very thought that keeps a lot of people enduringly clean (""the drugs won't help me"") was probably a reason to use for you guys. In fact, because dopaminergic drugs reinforce whatever pattern of thought leads to use, and in your case that pattern of thought is ""I just want to do anything to get away from the knowledge we lost our baby"", the drugs will be keeping the thought ""I lost my baby"" at maximum freshness in your mind. The only advice I can give you is this - try to see the pain as a symptom of the drug use, because it is. A year and a half after losing a baby you should be feeling much better, but through the manipulation of the drugs you won't be. Try to see those drugs for what they are: the reason you're still in pain.

jhl6ota,"There are a few Traditions that lend themselves to an AAer having a lenient, or at least apathetic, view on this. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking, the primary purpose of each group is to carry the message to the alcoholic who still suffers, and AA should have no opinion on outside issues. Basically, as an AA member, I have no business telling anyone that smoking pot means they're not sober. I'm here to help people have spiritual experience that will ensure they can stay sober.

jhkbm0w,">It's not accurate to say that someone needs to stop all substances to recover from one I'm afraid the science actually does support that - the addiction mechanism of these drugs is all the same. It doesn't matter whether you're taking alcohol, marijuana, cocaine or any other addictive drug: all create an artificial increase in dopamine which triggers belief formation as their addiction mechanism. Their primary effects may differ, but their primary effect is unrelated to why you become addicted: a person who is taking antabuse literally cannot experience the primary effect of alcohol (they cannot get drunk and experience nausea when they consume it), yet the total absence of the primary effect of alcohol does not prevent the overwhelming majority of people taking the drug from continuing to drink. That's because its secondary dopaminergic effect is still happening - even though they feel nothing but unpleasantness, the addict continues to form drug-induced beliefs that using will ""help"". This is the same with cocaine - even when a person's tolerance has become so high, or their physical state so poor that they cannot actually undergo the ""high"", they still continue to abuse the drug, because the effect you feel has nothing to do with what makes it addictive. The same is true of weed - a person can smoke weed, absolutely hate the resulting state, loathe every minute of the time they spent in front of the TV or playing video games, yet still continue to abuse it: the primary effect has nothing to do with why you get addicted. NA's reason for saying you cannot use any drug is wrong - they say it's not because the drugs all do the same thing but because all addicts have a spiritual problem, which is nonsense. However in saying that you cannot take one drug to replace another they are absolutely correct: the change in the nature of the high has zero benefit as the damaging mental health effect of the new substance is identical.",1682367484.0

Then I’m like « wait a minute so Just in order to say I’m sober of weed I’m willing to quit it all? » it doesn’t seem worth it for everyone to avoid weed, especially if it’s something that can calm you like it does to me. But I feel very conflicted about it. I still use nicotine and I smoke so much more nicotine and tobacco when I’m not smoking weed. So I’m confused about what to do. If someone can help me please. I successfully quit alcohol and don’t plan on going back to it. But weed… was doing a good job delaying the self harm at least.

jhjg5un,"So I’ve done both and I felt like NA was a better fit for me, but your best bet is not only trying both NA and AA but also going to all the different meetings in your area. There are phone apps that show all the meetings/times in your area. They all follow the same frameworks but there is a noticeable difference in every group I’ve attended which is why I recommend going to different groups and even times of the day like morning, lunch, afternoon or weekends. Most NA groups I’ve been to have been great and are filled with people that genuinely want to help you but my unpopular opinion is some NA groups can be kinda sketchy. Some locations also have meetings with way more people attending and you might not feel as comfortable sharing or even have the opportunity to share. Going to smaller meetings though may mean you’ll feel more pressured to share to fill time so it might not be right for you if you are shy or nervous being new. All that being said I think going made a difference to my staying sober for 5 years of drugs and alcohol. I did go to rehab which I would recommend to everyone trying to get sober as you are taken out of your environment and helped get me 30 days clean, then did 90 meetings in 90 days which is what they recommend.

jhj52bu,"I personally stopped attending meetings when I was certain I was no longer taking drugs. My suspicion is that if a person is still attending meetings half a century after getting sober, they're either not sober or they never migrated from sobriety into functioning. I know some people do hang around to help people in recovery with their own experience, but if they'd spend the better part of 50 years laboring under that objective they should be incredible at it, yet they're laughing at newcomers in meetings. In one of my early meetings, I made it clear that I did not currently want a sponsor. A person touting 10 years told me that I was choosing to fail, and that I'm just one of ""a long line of idiots"" who've tried to go against the program and failed. Well, I did not fail - I am now in my second year of sobriety. What's more, towards the end of my time with NA another individual who had that 10-year person as their sponsor dropped me a line asking for advice because that individual was calling them in the middle of the night in a state that looked suspiciously like ""blackout drunkenness"". I did not have an answer for them, but the answer for me was to recognize that my need for those meetings had reached its terminus So when you said this... >Yet I've overcome alcohol. I'll be 10 years free from it soon and I couldn't tell you how many years ago I had my last craving. I didn't need spirituality for that. I didn't need steps barked at me without even knowing them. I feel exactly the same way. But then again, I don't begrude the people who stay in the program: it certainly helped me, even if it primarily helped me by showing me a lot of ways that people can turn ""recovery"" against themselves. Just because I enjoy continuing a rant I will also add this - the biiiiig problem I found with 12-steps was the idea that the drug isn't the cause of addiction, a ""spiritual problem"" with an addict is. This is tantamount to saying that drugs are not addictive, and that it's merely the personal weakness of the addict that creates addiction. Well, if there was ever a good justification to use that was it - if drugs are not the cause of the problem, that means you can fix yourself and then it's fine to take drugs, after all they were never the real issue.

jhizwm9,">My thought cycles have become more positive on average over the year, but I'm not completely immune to negativity (who is). At this point in time being 100% clean might actually work for me without dragging me down too much on average. But I never really considered the idea, I just thought I wasn't made to live such a life. And thinking that may very well turn that into truth, because you simply believe that about yourself. It may be the same mechanic you describe here: The problem is this - it's impossible to take a dopaminergic drug without its dopaminergic action making the very problem you take it to ""help"" with feel more accute. That's a trait of them - if you think ""I'm stressed so I need to smoke weed"" or ""my girlfriend is garbage I need to take cocaine to coke"", then the dopaminergic action of the drug makes you more likely to think ""I'm stressed"" or ""my girlfriend is garbage"". That is 100% harmful - you literally cannot take a drug without it worsening the very problem for which you take it. In your case, you think ""I need to alter my mind to enjoy life"", then you take a dopaminergic drug, and now your tendency to think ""I need to alter my mind"" increases. That belief does not come from you - it comes from the drug. If you step back a moment and analyse it, you'll see that it is objectively ridiculous, as are all drug-induced beliefs - the drug has done exactly what makes it addictive, hijacked your dopamine system and caused you to stop pursuing the things all human beings need and instead pursue things only the drug delivers. ""Mind alteration"" is not a human need, and when you're at home alone taking drugs you're actually missing out on all of the things that are. >Right now I'm at a point where I'm not opposed to giving everything a shot, but I'm not convinced yet that 100% sobriety is actually my goal. I Then do not have it as a goal, after all ""being sober"" is not an objective but simply the natural state of a human being. The real question to ask is ""when I stop taking a substance which, as a matter of necessity, forces me to choose goals that can only be achieved with it, what will my goal be?"". A human being who consumes alcohol will necessary choose ""getting drunk"" as a goal (and that's true of millions of people who don't identify as addicts - you see it every Friday and Saturday night), and a human being who takes heroin will choose ""getting doped-up"" as a goal, because the drug forces them to do that. But if they stop, they'll eventually choose an actual goal - one that has a chance to fulfill them, and not the drug. I'd suggest that you might want to make ""freeing yourself form chemical influences that change your perception of what your goal should be"" your goal, and then let whatever is going to emerge out of that emerge on its own.",1682348849.0
jhiyq17,"I am absolutely, 100% certain it's the same problem as alcohol. Alcohol and Cannabis' primary effect is different which is why you experience a different thing when you take them - Alcohol enhances the activity of GABA which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter whereas the THC in cannabis binds to endocannabinoid receptors. However their secondary effect, the effect which makes them addictive (and which has no physical sensation associated with them) is identical: both cause the neurons they interact with to release dopamine, something that would normally only happen if something of value was perceived by the user (and which would only happen significantly the first time that happened), but which happens every single time a person uses these drugs. The release of dopamine triggers the process that forms a new belief - it causes the user to repeat whatever pattern of thought caused them to use. If a user drinks alcohol or smokes cannabis to ""relax"", the tendency to think ""I am stressed and need to relax"" is increased. The user doesn't experience an increased craving for the drug, they experience an increased tendency to enter the belief structure that caused them to use the drug. Your use of cannabis means you are unclean - everything that makes alcohol addictive is something you are still experiencing by taking cannabis. This is the exact same addiction mechanism of every other drug too - cocaine, MDMA, meth, all opioids, and even the majority of benzodiazepines (and all of the ones people get addicted to) are dopaminergic. In all of them, the problem they believe the drugs ""help"" with is actually a problem the drugs cause. >I started smoking pot again for when I'm at home, playing games or watching shows Right, you've started using a drug for the simplest of daily tasks. Well, you're going to experience cannabis dopaminergic effect - every time you take the drug thinking ""this helps me enjoy video games or watching TV shows"", it will strengthen the belief ""I like watching TV shows and playing video games"". Evey time you use, your tendency to lay around watching TV and playing video games will increase, until pretty soon that's all you do, because the drug-induced belief is more potent than any belief induced by a natural source. Does that sound like recovery to you? I'm willing to wager you already did this with alcohol and video games, and that it led to you doing nothing useful with your life. All you've done is trade one chemical for another one with an identical effect. If you want to recover from drugs, you need to stop taking drugs. They are all doing exactly the same thing and will lead you to exactly the same place, not because you have a problem but because doing so is an innate characteristic of these drugs. You can never say ""I've worked on myself enough to take a drug"" because the problem is not you, it's the drug itself.",1682348368.0

jhiufj7,"Warning: I do use the Anonymous programs in my recovery, so some terminology may be offensive to those against said programs. I was informed early on in recovery that anytime you intermingle with alcoholics/addicts you are dealing with sick people. Some sicker than others.

I have been sober/clean long enough to deal with pretty much every level of sickness/healthiness in the gatherings of sober/clean people I deal with. I was also shown a new way to utilize my existing spirituality (NEVER religion) to help me maintain my sobriety through the 12 steps. Utilizing the steps to relearn my way of living was an eye-opening, logical, ordered method for me to get a new way of life through my thick head. Meetings are full of people gathering for support, the program/methods are in the literature. Every person that has obtained sobriety/clean time has done it their own way. Many will think theirs is the only way. I learned to take suggestions from those sharing actual data from the literature, and some sharing from experience they had if it fit for me.

jhhtjx5,"What a fascinating comment. It seems to me like you're approaching addiction from a rational perspective with lots of knowledge about what's going on chemically. I never did that, I just kinda learned to trust my feeling. Once you cross the threshold where things that are good for you are the new normal, the rest kinda happened by itself. For many years I've been at the same point though. I couldn't tell you when I craved alcohol for the last time. After a few years I even knew I was far enough along that having a little bit of alcohol in a cake is not a problem at all. I love Tiramisu. I can eat it and taste the alcohol without it causing cravings, because I'm not eating Tiramisu to get drunk. I couldn't tell you how I reached that point but I know that level of security suits me well. I think it's a good thing I never worked on any steps knowingly. Some of the things I did can be described by a step, but these meetings feel very much like the blind leading the blind. Anyway, so your goal was to become 100% clean and that was your starting point so to speak? Because I became sober from alcohol almost 10 years ago and my goal from the start was ""I don't wanna suffer from it. I wanna overcome it."" - I never formulated it like that back then, but it was what I wanted and it turned into my reality. Now, I never really thought beyond singular substances. I've said for a long time that I can't really imagine a life without and sort of mind-alteration going on. It's always been an escape for me that I welcome. Some vacation time from my head, if you will. My thought cycles have become more positive on average over the year, but I'm not completely immune to negativity (who is). At this point in time being 100% clean might actually work for me without dragging me down too much on average. But I never really considered the idea, I just thought I wasn't made to live such a life. And thinking that may very well turn that into truth, because you simply believe that about yourself.

I noticed that with the stim addiction I'm overcoming right now. Until the end I thought that I was more productive on the drug. Only near the end or during my one relapse did I realize that was an illusion. I have less fun working now, but I finish stuff faster and it's easier. Anyway, what I'm not sure about yet is whether my belief that I'm not built for 100% sobriety is a self-fulfilling prophecy that can change, or whether it's simply part of my personality that I have to accept. Right now I'm at a point where I'm not opposed to giving everything a shot, but I'm not convinced yet that 100% sobriety is actually my goal. I might be fine with a life of plant-based drugs only. Seems like an upgrade to the chemical hell I just put myself through. I'm really curious where this will lead me.

jhg5i16,"I really recall these kinds of insights at your level - it's exactly what you need to be sober (I'm now in my second year of sobriety, and have been 100% free of the urge to use for at-least 8 months). First you avoid triggers - this keeps your brain free of the belief-altering dopaminegic action of the drug, the action that tricks the brain into forming whatever beliefs are needed to justify more drug use. Without this, time and your own natural ability to observe reality does the work. The ultimate reality, one I hope you come to understand, is that everything you believed about the drugs was false - that's what makes dopaminergic drugs (which is all to the ones we abusive) addictive: they induce the brain to form whatever belief justifies more use. What you ""feel"" is true about the drug - that it was a crutch or a way of coping, is false: it never did help, it merely felt like it did because that's how the drug's chemical action influences you. You see this effect everywhere when you know where to look - alcohol is a dopaminergic drug, which is why you get people who think they're ""whiskey"" or ""vodka"" connoisseurs and talk about the alleged taste qualities of these substances. These substances have no taste qualities - they taste like having your mouth pissed in, yet the dopaminergic action of the drug makes people who take them interpret that piss-in-mouth taste as something enjoyable because that's exactly what you'd need to believe in order to justify consuming more. The exact same effect happens with cigars, and you even get cocaine addicts talking about their perceived relative sensations of different types of cocaine when it goes up their nose. Once you realize all that is true, you're free: you cannot ever believe that taking the drug would be a good idea. No more strength is required.",1682288543.0

jhfjo2u,"There’s lots of good advice on here… i was a hardcore alcoholic from 21-31 and reached the point where I was stagnant in my life while others were moving on. I quit cold turkey and went to 12 step meetings (I preferred NA meetings at first, but went to both) I didn’t know the risk of quitting alcohol cold turkey, apparently the detox can be deadly depending on your dependence… so that is something to consider. I have been sober almost 8 and a half years, since 1/2/15. I will say that a few years prior I got a dui and did a outpatient that was court ordered, it took some time to creep in that I really had a problem. I did learn some things from outpatient but I also wasn’t ready to quit. So you have some options besides inpatient rehab. You can get a medical detox like others have suggested, go to 12 step and use the rooms as building blocks for recovery. You can go get an assessment at a drug and alcohol treatment center, they can tell you what your best options are (outpatient or impatient rehab). They will have classes you go to several times a week while you live your life outside in the real world, they’ll also suggest that you do 12 step as well if you go outpatient route. Another option no one has mentioned is going to your states Dshs website and look to see if they offer low cost/free health insurance you can use to get into a rehab. I know where I am in Wa state that is an option. You may also want to meat with a psychiatrist who specializes in addiction as well, you could possibly be dual diagnosed as addicted because of a possible mental health condition. I was diagnosed as adhd as a kid but my parents thought I could grow out of it, between that and trauma early on I turned to alcohol, I also suffered from social anxiety and depression connected to my adhd and would drink to loosen up in social situations. Had my parents medicated me and I was able to learn positive coping strategies I would not have begun to drink. I most recently got an adult diagnosis at 39, and went on straterra which is a non stimulant and my anxiety and depression and over rumination of thoughts has gone away due to my medication, I’m also on Wellbutrin which helps as well. I wish I had gone on atleast one of these way earlier because I would have had more dopamine and emotional stability earlier in my recovery.

jhdjn78,"> You will know peace and serenity once you take responsibility for your emotions, and in a much larger sense your recovery. Nobody owes you anything and nobody is responsible for maintaining your stability — even if they come up and smack you directly in the mouth. How you react, feel, and move on from that is your choice alone. You need to stop concerning yourself with my peace and serenity and start thinking about yours. I will stop responding to you now because you have now crossed my boundaries 3 times after I set them, which is further proof that you do not mean well. I am going to use you to start teaching future readers of our conversation: --- Hi everyone, just to explain what's happening here. This is a person who chose the wrong people to look up to and now they emulate them without understanding what's going on, they just notice it feels good and their justification is that they're ""helping addicts"". Unfortunately, what's happening is: This person has been treating me condescendingly from the start, began by barking steps at me instead of talking to me like I'm a human being. I have since asked multiple times to please be left alone. I count at least 5 comments by them now, most of them after I already asked them to leave me alone. They're using simple, non-scientific constructs to put me in a box that does not work for me. They do not hear a word I'm saying and keep preaching instead. I'm 100% convinced they never read my full post, and even if, I doubt they even tried to understand. I've seen this mindset of ""the active addict is unable to think normally so everything they say can be safely ignored"", and for some reason the people who think like that apply that mindset to me even after I've been clean for 3 months (and have made more mental progress than them apparently). This way to approach people and this mindset is harmful to the people they approach. This is not healthy and has no basis in science. By the fact that this person is ignoring all the boundaries I have set, you can recognize that they're doing this to feel superior to me. Always have to get the last word in, always have to tell me what to do about my emotions. No professional therapist works like that. This is harmful behaviour and it is hurting people. The fact that they feel the need to not relent shows that this is not about helping me. It's about their ego. --- One last time to you: If you respond to me again, I will report you for harassment. You're harming me. Stop it right now.",1682243875.0
jhdbpjd,"I’ve been to rehab twice, back when insurance was a little bit better on my end. The first time was amazing and I was so sure that that was it for me - The second time was moreso forced to go to try and salvage the life I had at that time - ended up being a bad choice as they kinda forced a sober living and geographical move on me… (which was amazing the first time but was the opposite of what I needed the 2nd - Sober living is a whole other discussion though) First time I was about your age, second time was at 27-28 and now I’m 30. Most recently, I was able to detox myself and essentially do the first 3 weeks of sobriety similar to what they would in a facility. If you absolutely can’t justify spending the money (your life is always worth it) there are things you can do to create a similar environment and get through the initial hump yourself. I’ve always said getting the first two weeks down is the hardest part of ANY quit (the second being staying sober 4-12 months later once life starts to get a little better and the consequences aren’t so close in the rear view) A big thing to keep in mind would also be your intake of alcohol and if you can or cannot safely quit… cocaine w/d is largely mental but alcohol can be very dangerous. You could also see a doctor and see if they would be able to get you some detox meds and treat any underlying issues (could also help you get an excuse to get time off work if needed) … most important thing is be honest with yourself and whatever choice you make, dive in. For me this last go around I just simply couldn’t afford to pay rehab at all let alone miss work and a whole months worth of $ and bills… i don’t guess there is a right way to do it except a way that protects your health and keeps you sober",1682236837.0
jhd8s81," -adults calling other adults sobbing and threatening to harm themselves is obscenely abnormal, as is that other adult not immediately recognizing that this individual needs professional help and creating a boundary that prevents co-dependence. [I don't know how to properly quote in this damn app, apologies] I only half agree with that, I don't think it's super common, but I don't agree it's obscenely abnormal. That's probably your experience, and not that you haven't had experience with mental health struggles, but those that have some kind degree of not well managed or even not diagnosed (or even medicated sometimes) mental health issues can tend to respond that way to extreme stress, if it's bad. And then generally they call the friend or loved one they trust the most, hopefully. You don't want them NOT to call... That's much worse. It's not like it happens often but it's not like you're gonna be calling the cops because they got upset and needed a friend badly. It's not like they hurt anyone else. You may know damn well that they need professional help and you try to talk to them and get them on board with it, but they never commit and again, are generally fine it's not like it's an ongoing thing. But maybe it's been a couple times and they're just trying to get through it and feel better, but not by getting help. Boundaries are important, but boundaries also can end lives if it's at a fragile time for someone. If it's not appropriate for them to call you when they need help so badly, then 99.7% of the time, you're not who they're calling. If it's someone that chooses you to call in that moment, it's someone you love. That's not someone that you can easily just say ""I'm not talking to you again until you get help"" when you know how broken and alone they feel. It's a ridiculous reason to drop a friend, but he felt disrespected, obviously. Which is on him because he's just plain wrong, and being inconsiderate/self absorbed right now. Maybe that's a chronic problem he has only exacerbated by doing seratonin depleting(etc) drugs. But also, OP, I'm certain that him not wanting to spend time with you is really mostly his using. I mean if you think about when you were, like it's not something that motivates you, to actually plan to hang out with someone sober. Unless it got you something.. that's how I was I know that. I just would see straight edge or sober people in my life less and less often. Especially if it was anything that required effort or being anywhere on time, just to have a coffee with someone sober... I wouldn't have done it. Honestly what I would do in this situation, is i would send him another message. Last one, unless he replied, obviously. I would say: Hey man I get it that you're feeling a type of way about me not helping you with that shit. I didn't say no just because I didn't want to help you out though. I got out of that game man, you know that. I deleted my old plug's number and I don't talk to a single person anymore that I could've ever gotten it from because I'm done with it. It's not like I could've hooked you up and just didn't want to. But regardless, I mean not wanting to fuck with me at all just over that is kinda getting to me. I actually thought you were one of my best friends, and as far as I was concerned, that meant a lot more than anything to do with some drugs. I figured you'd be in my wedding one day, like you're almost a damn brother to me and the way you're acting now sucks a lot. Can we move past this? You can talk to me or don't, but I wanted you to know that I think this is bullshit and I'd rather not lose you as a friend just because I'm not into this shit anymore. Use your own (less) words, but that's what I'd say, because obv I'm a professional with overly wordy messages. My point is, just be blunt with him. Text him and touch on those points I mentioned, or whatever you want to say at all, to just get across to him what is in your head about this. Just see if you can give him a figurative face slap and tell him to stop being a jerk and let it go, rather than to cut ties. Maybe mention that he doesn't know how much time he has left, or you have. Like, ""life's too short"" or whatever. This kind of shit might end up being a huge regret if someone is suddenly gone and leaves someone wishing they hadn't been so cold to them for the last year... But now it's too late.. That's what I'd do, and then if still nothing, that's really shitty and I'm sorry. Sometimes it's all too common to give our time and energy and care to people who end up showing that they don't deserve it. I don't want to tell you that he doesn't deserve your friendship, because he's your friend and that might still really mean something. But if you lay it all out for him and tell him how you feel, in whatever way you want and he still is ghosting you, then as fucked as it is, you just gotta be grateful that now you know and it only cost you that much time to figure out, he's not a real friend. Too much time, but at least you'd know it was over and you can just move on. I just think you should be on the same page. Maybe knowing how you feel about it might change his perspective... It's better than not doing it, I promise. Edited for spelling and many commas 😆",1682234322.0

jhc8k6c,"Alcohol has exactly the same addiction mechanism as every other drug - it's dopaminergic, meaning it hijacks the part of the brain that is normally only stimulated when we take actions that lead to contentment. What I will say is that your friends aren't ""enjoying"" drinks - they might believe they are, but alcohol is poisonous and addictive to them too. It's the second biggest cause of cancer after smoking and is the cause of most A&E visits. All of them suffer hangovers, at the very least. It's also the source of practically all antisocial behavior you see in towns and cities. It sounds like you perceive you to be the problem. This is why you felt you could drink again - if you think you are the problem, it's logical to think ""well, if I fix myself I can drink again - after all, the drug was never the problem"". You were never the problem: the drug was the problem. If you got that idea that you were to blame from 12-step literature, all I say is that you're best discarding it - drugs are poisonous (particularly psychologically) to everyone, not just you. Nobody should ever take them. That belief that the alcohol would have ""helped"" - that's a drug-induced belief. That poison helps nobody. Your consumption of it was not due to some spiritual problem in yourself, it was the same symptom of the poison that all of your friends were experiencing - they were all operating under the false belief that it would ""help"" that night. I think your perception of yourself as a failure is why you felt depressed. All I can say is that you're not a failure - you were in the same boat as everyone else that night. You were, in fact, the smartest person there - sure, you drank that night and used molly a year before, but you've begun to notice that these things are somehow ""not good"", despite the fact that they create the most convincingly psychological illusion of false ""goodness"" a human being can experience.

jhc47mc,"Xanax withdrawal hangs around a little longer than most. I think the average is up around 2/3months. I'm glad to hear you talked to your doctor about it. The danger/risk of a seizure is no joke. Mine didn't occur until two weeks after I had stopped. Really no ""symptoms"" or ""warning"" signs either. When I went to rehab two years later i was given an anticonvulsant after tapering to reduce the risk. Everything worked out just fine. If the plan is to kick the xanax, kick it. Going back to ""a little bit"" isn't going to make things much better for you. Like your doctor said, you weren't taking very much to begin with. The relief you would feel from .25mg or .5mg is would be more mental rather than physical. Your best friends are going to be exercise and meditation. I'm not denying physical withdrawal symptoms but a lot if the issues I dealt with were almost more of mental ones. The anxiety, restlessness, being wrapped up in my own head dealing with emotions/feelings I used to numb out, etc. Exercising and meditation helped out on various levels, physical ones included. Even three years out, if I'm not physically active during the day I don't sleep as well. Finally, if getting into therapy is an option, do it. Edit: again, you weren't taking very much. It's likely that any physical PAWS you feel will fade in a week or two rather than months. Hell, there's a good chance you might not really notice any at all! The bigger challenge will be finding new, healthy ways of coping with the ""mental gymnastics"". This might feel like a lot for awhile but it won't last. Most feelings come and go, such is life.

I had to get rid of all my ""friends"" who were like that although, as you experienced, most ""get rid"" of themselves.

jh9y78h,Ugh. So sorry! I have been there. I have always had nightmares almost nightly since trauma as a child.

Multiple nightmares per night and these awful nightmares when I would be falling asleep….it would be these horrifying loud noises and I would have them probably 10 times in a row as I was falling asleep….about 2 minutes between each one. I would have to get out of bed to make them stop. I was so exhausted. Good news is….now I have nightmares maybe 2-3 times per week and am able to fall asleep after them. I got therapy for my PTSD (EMDR) and a tincture of time being sober helps a ton. I had 7 years sober before my latest relapse and got to the point of having almost no nightmares. Prazosin helped mine a lot as well. I think you are going to have to seek help. Not sleeping is not good for a newly recovering person. It just makes everything in life more difficult to deal with.

The trauma nightmares are upsetting and I do still wake up a million times a night scared or crying or whatever but you get used to it over time. I won't say it gets better for me at least, but it's just the new normal after a few years and I can ignore it better. I don't think there's a good solution any of us can give you. I would suggest maybe try EMDR therapy if that is an option, or consult a doctor. There are no meds that really work for ptsd but they do have some sleep and nightmare meds out there now that could possibly help you stay asleep and avoid nightmares. You may not want to try the really addictive or dependency forming ones but shit like trazadone is pretty irrelevant and this one nightmare med I've heard good things about that isn't addictive and has no recreational value. I don't do any of that, not for me and I know a lot of other addicts relate so smoking weed honestly helps me a ton. Is it full sobriety? No but I don't care and for me it doesn't lead to other use, but rather makes me desire those less. Something about thc makes you less able to get deep sleep and you don't remember your dreams if you're high. The tradeoff is worse sleep quality but it works for me and I'd rather have 8 hours of shitty sleep than 2 hours of tossing and turning and revisiting things I'd rather not in a detailed manner that I can remember. Benadryl puts my ass to sleep too idk. You probably also still have some degree of post acute wds if you were using opioids very consistently for a long time and that makes getting to sleep and staying asleep a struggle.

jh6bcfe,"If you want to keep your marriage, you'll need to figure out if she wants the same. The easiest way to do this is for both of you to get individual counseling and couples counseling. The individual counseling will help identify the issues that need to be discussed in couples counseling, and help develop the language that's most effective for that environment. Finding effective counseling isn't always easy. It may take a few sessions to figure out if you and the counselor you're seeing are a good match. You may go through a few counselor before you find one that works for you. If at all possible, try to find a counselor that has some experience with substance use disorder treatment, although that may be a tall order since its a different discipline from Marriage Family Therapy (MFT). My wife and I both did about a year of individual counseling and a year of couples counseling concurrently. This was early in our recovery. Going on 15+ years of active recovery. Been married for 17 years, together for well over 20. The only other tip i can give about the counseling, if you decide that you want to keep and work on the relationship, make sure the individual counselors, and the couples counselor you're seeing are on the same page. A lot of them will steer toward separation and individual happiness if its unclear that both sides want the relationship to work out.",1682101291.0

I got down to about a quarter mg, and started skipping days. Then I’d skip 2 days, and so on. Anxiety was the #1 hardest part of withdrawals. I took a good multivitamin, extra B, C and D, and probiotics. The probiotics helped me a ton. I also cut out all sugary drinks and went to a high protein whole foods diet. Drink lots of water.

That group showed me a lot, but it was NOT good for me. I shared here afterwards, and it helped. And the progress of that previous week has not been undone. Instead, it has instantly unearthed the next issue, the rejection thing. And I haven't been thrown off my path yet, even though It's been rough at times. I have handled it so far, even though I'm not always in control of the dark spirals. I don't automatically devolve to drug abuse in those spirals and that's a great sign, my rational mind knows that.

I encourage you to keep searching for a group you feel you fit well with.

After talking with her, I felt reminded why it’s important for me (& many recovering addicts) to be pretty consistently connected with other recovering addicts. During that time alone, I kept thinking maybe the whole community thing wasn’t for me & that I was just going to do it my way, but obviously it wasn’t working well.

I’ve been in recovery for 2 years but have had 2 little slip ups in that time, the most recent being 5mo ago. I am grateful to be where I am today, but I am not blind to the fact that I am just as susceptible to a relapse as any other addict, I have to work for my recovery, & while it’s worth the effort, it’s hard to do sometimes. When one addict who is struggling or recently went through struggling times finds the courage to be vulnerable with another addict & open up, there are insightful things to learn from that struggling addict, even when they don’t realize it. I know not every recovering addict is going to view things the same as me. Again, with all due respect to the people in that group, it sounds like they would like to live their recovery only half-honestly.

So whatever issues you had before suffering from addiction, are still going to be there.

They also weren't rigid on your DOC, if you suffer from addiction you are welcome, and I've heard great wisdom from people who had never used my DOC. There is the risk of falling into the wrong crowd, like those just going because they have to, and obviously there's still a mix of personalities, but for the most part they were the most welcoming and helpful for me.

And for some, that is a miracle and for others recovery includes more. In my experience, over the years I’ve been clean, I don’t believe everything in my life was because I became dependent on opiates and crossed the line into addiction, I’m also a human being and that in itself has its faults. That helped me a lot, remembering I’m an imperfect human being with different experiences from childhood to adulthood that formed who I am and there was my time using.

And I am thankful that she isn't in mine because I knew she couldn't handle that. She got enough on her plate, that much is obvious. I love writing this stuff out. It's like I'm developing the way I want to see this in real time. This is therapeutic, there's absolutely no doubt about it. And I needed you to tell me that you're proud of me for sharing my dark shit, because that's not very easy to feel especially in such a situation. So I REALLY appreciate your comment, honestly. A simple acknowledgement like that is just what I needed. I want to be able to find this empathetic view faster.

I need time to process situations like that so I can respond to her I would with a clear head (so I'm waiting for the clear head). I think this woman needs to hear that her sensitivies did not help me in that moment, but I'd have to say it with a lot of compassion so she doesn't feel attacked. A delicate balance I can't do without preparation. That's why I'm glad we didn't talk after. I'm also a big fan of sleeping a night over this, because it really is nothing in the grand scheme of things. I went there to share my success of having withstood a dark temptation. That happened either way. I can take the feelings this encounter caused me. And seeing that I can take them, shows me my progress again. So as everything else, there's something positive to conclude from it, something to gain, something to learn.

That’s how bad my tolerance was. And even then, I could only put together maybe a month. That was with throwing myself into gig work (I couldn’t hold down a job while I was using) and outdoor activities and trying to live as healthy as I could.

Anyways, it will take time for your brain to feel better. At the two week mark you're just getting started. I was x-addicted to h and coke but I remember being so exhausted all the time from coming off that shit, but it got better. I also had to give in... I thought I could do my recovery my way and dip and dabble when I wanted to but when that didnt work (after like 7 times of trying to) I finally gave in and took the counselors and NA old timers suggestion. It took me a long time to get to that point, but if you do listen to what they have to say and take their suggestions I promise it will help you soooo much!!! Go to a meeting every day!! I know it's hard. But when you can take an honest look at yourself and your recovery and know that its something as important to you as the need to breathe, or eat, or sleep then it will come to you naturally. And once you keep going to those meetings and listening to suggestions and support it will start to come to you.

Just bare with it, after the two week mark it gets worse for a while, cravings get bad for a while. But stick with it it will get better!!!! 💯And it's sooo worth it because when the cravings subside, it feels so good to wake up and not think about getting high every day. Some people get on Wellbutrin for a while because it kinda works on some of the same receptors but it's an antidepressant (the only one that only works on dopamine).

Until one day, I was driving to my pick up spot and just turned around, decided to go to the movies instead. Yes, yes and yes, get busy, get yourself busy and tired so you can crave your bed and a great night of sleep. Sounds silly, but amongst other things, something that helped me get clean was to get my sleep schedule back to normal. At the end of the day, take a long shower and get cozy in bed. Lots of walking early in the morning and lots of sleep resume my early recovery. But most of all, get some help. Therapy, groups, whatever, but get help. Coke is a bitch to quit and it can be painful to do it on your own. I kept trying and relapsing hard until I started jungian therapy and to me, it was life changing. Not only I quit coke, I turned my life around in many other aspects… Be patient. Have in mind that recovery takes a really long time.

jgsjx4r,"Have you read about cocaine recovery specifically? Everyone who is completely accustomed to using cocaine is going to struggle same as you for weeks. Sorry if you already understand this but cocaine acts by causing you to overproduce specific neurotransmitters, exhausting your supply for a time. CBT teaches you to interrogate your thoughts. This isn't just a thought process. Your brain is legit compromised until you can get through many,many weeks to let your neurotransmitter supply recover. You are not just craving a drug you are in a deficit state that is physically really hard for anyone to cope with. You are lacking in neurotransmitters that everybody needs in order to get through the day. You need time to physically heal and until then it is rough going. You'll.heal, everyone can, it takes time and the suffering is real. It helps to know that the worst will pass because your brain will absolutely recover. This is in contrast with, for example, marijuana which directly bonds with neuroreceptors to cause effects - cocaine does not bond with neuroreceptors - it causes you to flood with neurotransmitters until your brain can't produce more.. Also - it is well documented that the people.most attracted to cocaine tend to also have existing executive function disorder - like ADHD - that requires treatment. Stimulants are the primary pharmaceutical treatment for ADHD. Talk to a psychiatrist who specializes in addiction treatment. If you have a cocaine anonymous around you - it is really good to talk to someone who used like you use now, and who has succeeded in getting more.than a year no cocaine.",1681850275.0

jgmvpxf,"If you can’t take Adderall without abusing it to the point that you start stealing medication, you aren’t “doing” sobriety with Adderall. I know it feels like you are, because regardless of what other people may say there is room for nuance and one person’s sobriety is another person’s addiction, and some people can maintain potentially problematic relationships with potentially problematic substances in a way that results in a net gain for their overall life - but the way you’re describing it - I really don’t think stimulants are for you. I started a stimulant prescription about a year after I stopped my DOC and have maintained a relatively healthy relationship with it (there have been a few times when I’d run out a day or two early) but overall my life is significantly improved by them, and I would never steal medication from someone. There are other ways to manage ADD symptoms, and other meds that aren’t as addictive that can have similar effects. Wellbutrin is one. Various nootropics can help. And of course there’s physical activity, which is of course harder to do when the motivation isn’t there and you don’t want to move, but even a few minutes a day cascades over time and IMO whenever I’ve been in a slump, I find that just picking one thing that I know helps and trying to stick with it eventually leads to me picking up other helpful things, just cause of how the brain works behind your conscious awareness. Anyways - I understand needing a stimulant. I need one to function semi well. What dose were you taking? There’s recent research suggesting that lower dose stimulant use is pretty bad for your brain and that paradoxically it’s better to start higher and then lower it if it’s too much. And intermittent stimulant use is horrible for your brain. It never has time to fully adjust and it constantly swinging between trying to compensate for the extra dopamine, or trying to compensate for the lack of it, which, particularly with low dose regimens, your brain doesn’t tend to do a great job of. It more or less torches your dopamine system, and some effects can be lifelong. I’m not a professional so please do not listen to what I’m about to say without consulting one/reading up - but from what I’ve read (in actual papers, not from randos online) a potential way to undo any hypothetical damage that might for example lead to you not even feeling slightly better after two years of abstinence is to start with a much higher dose than you’re used to, and ratchet down from there until you’re comfortable, instead of trying to white knuckle it by starting low and slowly going up.",1681752290.0

jgh39fp,"I was once (many times actually) in a similar situation. Addicted to heroin, homeless and with zero support. My thoughts were negative, all the time. I was sick and miserable or high and miserable. I could not escape it. I eventually found myself in prison, it was here buried behind a 40 foot concrete wall and massive entanglements of steal where I became aware of just how much my own thoughts played a role in how I felt physically, mentally and emotionally. It was here I became aware that I held way more power than I ever thought possible. It wasn’t easy, it didn’t come naturally and I didn’t see the results I have seen today for a really really long time so it was something I had to pick up and put down several times over several years before I truly understood what it could become in my life. To put it simply, I became aware of a connection. A connection between my mind and body, spirit and stature. Some call it mindfulness, but that word doesn’t do this connection justice. For it has become the very blood in my body, the marshmallow to my chocolate and gram crackers. Let’s back up, before I became privy to my own lack of connection I thought things happened to me. I was always victim in my mind even when I KNEW I wasn’t, much like you’ve expressed in this post. Alongside that my thoughts were negative, these were two things I would come to learn NEEDED to go. But I didn’t know how, or even what that meant. The way I’ve learned to combat this is by getting a better understand of my self talk. The voice that I speak TO myself with inside my head. My experience has taught me that I can practice kind but honest self talk and eventually it will change the narrative so to speak to where my thoughts are not automatically negative, no longer is my baseline complete shit. Now putting some more positive self talk into practice was a challenge at first, I took an approach similar to that of how I learned meditation. What I do is concentrate on where my focus is, as I guide it from distraction and the natural chaos of the mind to a steady, secure path of which I have more control. Every time my mind strays, once I catch it I gently guide it back on track. At first this is maddening, it can be like every 10 seconds I’m loosing track and feeling like I’m never really getting there. It took time, but eventually that focus became sharper and sharper, it came with more ease and stayed true longer and longer. I tried to keep this comment simple, I kept from elaborating too deeply because this is a serious tool, and the dive can get DEEP if you really wanna know just how powerful the mind can be. But for your case OP, to kinda bring this full circle for you, is to learn what mindfulness means to you, to open a connection between your mind and body, then through practice deepen that connection. On this journey learning how to apply things like positive self talk and meditation will allow for an introspective view into who you are and will help guide you as you become the person you wish to be.",1681648191.0

jge0rsh,"Oh, yeah, honey. Give yourself a big break right now. It's going to be a little while before your body and brain reach a sober stasis. It's normal to feel tired and generally unmotivated right now. The first 30 days, you're coping with breaking a mental habit as well as a physical one. In some cases, that's all a person can do... give yourself the freedom from expectation of doing anything other than the bare minimum you must do to get by...obviously, if you have a family or a job or pets that require your ongoing, daily attention, you have to get through that. But everything else? That shit can wait. After the first 30-45 days of abstinence, you might find yourself a little more energetic, a little more motivated. Take it slow and don't be too hard on yourself, but take advantage of those days. The second phase of sobriety, maybe days 45-120 usually feel better, a little easier. You got through the first biggest hard part, the quitting and staying quit. Once you get to the next milestones, 60 days, 90 days, you start feeling more settled, proud of the time you've got behind you, and also your body is working towards regaining it's baseline without substances. That will feel different. If your DOC is weed, remember that thc is a depressant and that you've been operating at depressed levels of the chemicals in your brain that are supposed to help regulate our bodies.

jgcfui2,"So the Basic Text is just the beginning of NA. The core of the program is in working steps in which you read It Works: How and Why. And with your sponsor you work the steps with the workbook Step Working Guide which is a very comprehensive book that has like 50 deep questions for each step that you’re supposed to write on and speak with your sponsor on. It takes people about a month a step if they have the time to really dedicate to it. Like a question a day. Not a lot of people have the time to think on and write on and speak with their sponsor daily. Sometimes it takes a year to work step one. Seriously. Because the first three steps are the most important, your sponsor won’t let you move on until you’ve really surrendered. Because the next steps are really emotionally taxing, so they want to make sure you are ready. In AA, you’ll do the steps much faster because the focus is on the external factor of alcohol. Where in NA, YOU are the problem, but really the disease of addiction in you. It goes much deeper and tackles the overall concept of addiction and how it bleeds into every facet of your life. AA does this to a certain extent but not as detailed and complicated. For addicts in NA, they’ve done a variety of drugs including alcohol. So the thinking is rather than target the specifics of why someone would be drawn to one type of substance, better to tackle everything. Because someone who just does uppers can be treated differently than someone who just does downers. But for overall addicts, they’re more likely to substitute a different substance once they kick the one they want to. If you go to Marijuana Anonymous their form of recovery is super simple and it works because it’s not as life or death. For drug addicts, the highs are more extreme and instantaneous and so are the consequences and the behaviors are very cunning, so NA is designed to effectively squash any workarounds in which the disease of addiction manifests itself. Alcoholics don’t tend to die immediately from an overdose. Nor do they get to the point where they are prostituting themselves and stealing from others for their next fix. Once you get to that point, it takes a lot more to get people out of that, so NA is designed to not only help people get out of that scenario but also for the causal user. That’s their texts have been constantly updated and modernized. Because drugs also evolve and then people still abuse drugs that existed hundreds of years ago. The singular focus on alcohol in The Big Book lends itself to simplicity, which helps the accessibility of recovery to all alcoholics. To maintain recovery in AA is through meetings, a lot of them, and sharing and the AA community and talking to your sponsor. They work the steps and that’s important, but there’s an emphasis on meetings to maintain. Meetings in NA are the beginning foundation to recovery and The Basic Text is an explainer of the program. The meat and potatoes of the program is working the steps. Which is a life changing process that will show you “a new way to live.” So it’s not really the difference between the two books. It’s what is the difference between the two programs? In AA you do all the things and the meetings and the community will show you that you don’t need alcohol. In NA you do all the things and work the steps and it will help arrest your addictive tendencies. After you work the steps, you can read the text Living Clean and that details what your new life will be like. So AA is like “you don’t need alcohol, it ruined your life. Here’s an amazing group of people that will show you how good life can be without alcohol.” It replaces an external with a better external. NA is like “let this group help fix all this shit inside of you, so you can see the benefit of a life without drugs.” It replaces an internal with an internal. To put it simply it’s Meetings vs Steps. Try out both and focus on whatever one works for you at the moment. No one cares how you recover, only that you do.",1681557549.0

As an old mom, with 6 kiddos, can I offer a couple unsolicited pieces of advice? 1- don't stress or get scared by people sharing their horror story deliveries! People been having babies for thousands of years.....since the beginning of time. 2- if you are able to, get a few frozen easy meals pre-made that can just go in the oven or crock pot, and disposable plates/cups/cutlery. 3- patients have different rights when delivering babies, so read up on them. The delivering in any position was one I wish I'd known. 4- don't let any of your past issues make you feel any kinda way. I really struggled with this, feeling as though people could just ""tell"", or feeling unable to speak up or trust my choices. Looking back....I could kick my butt.

Consider discussing your options with a medical professional specializing in addiction treatment. Having a good support network is another key element to staying in active recovery. Its good that your mom is there for you, but would be better if you had a few more supportive people you could talk to. You need to cut all communication with the person you are posting about.

I don't know anything about weed's effect on the liver. But a good friend of mine who is a nutrition scientist told me that 1-2 cups of coffee a day are good for the liver. She told me that grinding the beans yourself is better because pre-made powder often attracts a certain type of fungus that's bad. Not gonna vouch for that though, because those are my words and she told me that a few years ago. She's a scientist but this is from a drug addicts memory. And I didn't care enough to buy a coffee grinder, so... Either way, could you maybe talk to that doc? Oh and: > Wife keeps saying she fancies a drink, which is fair enough but I don’t want to. That's not enough information to come to a conclusion, but tread carefully. There are relationship dynamics that negatively affect your recovery, especially if you have a partner that does not understand what addiction means for you and that a loving partner's job in that case is to keep that shit away from you. No support or active work from your partner against your recovery can have destructive consequences. But like I said, it's impossible to tell if that is applicable in your case. Just something you should be on the outlook for in your recovery.

I am however autistic (found out because a psychologist in rehab said she suspected it) there is a med that can help with those nightmares once you are sober. Its also given to people with ptsd who suffer from their nightmares a lot. You can ask about that once you are inpatient. Honestly i dont have much advice. From 23to30 i used everything in all ways and was not a happy person. The urge to numb was bigger then me. Not anymore. I have never felt as good as i am now. And everyday i wake up feeling happy i managed another day in sobriety. I do have suboxone on the lowest dose. My trust in myself is something i am working on. I also got people telling me im smart and “throwing it all away” and teachers telling me from an early age “you can do better you just dont do it” it was very frustrating to me. However being sober did not just fix that. Now i have a good day if i manage to cook some food and clean my home a bit. I have no high expectations of myself anymore. The expectations i took over from other people. Now id rather have a calm day and watch some youtube and play games haha. Nobody will tell me what to do anymore.

Working through things and finding out why I feel that way helped me. I think that and a mix of the time needed for our brain and bodies to heal. I had some skill regression and other issues from being an addict for so long. Your not alone in sobriety not feeling like rainbows and butterflies. I do believe tho if you keep trying to figure things out and put effort in your recovery it’ll improve in some ways. Good luck and congrats on your journey so far",1681414787.0

I see your desperation, and I want to tell you so much that it gets better. But unfortunately that requires work from you while you are in the worst possible condition to take active steps. It feels really unfair at times. It's not easy to reprogram yourself. I was just lucky enough that it kinda happened automatically for me. I started associating drinking with ruining my life. It ceased being an option, and I couldn't explain to you all process that lead to it. But idealization of what the substance is what makes it hard, and the process to undo it is not straightforward. The opening up part helped me so much. I used /r/stopdrinking a lot back in the day, but in that other thread here I heard that it's become a little more toxic there over the years?

It was a lie though. My drug did affect my sexuality, and so does getting clean right now. I expect to not be in the mood for sex for ~6 months. But what I may have lost is not part of my identity, it's violent lust. I couldn't see that during those cravings. You have a lot of brain fog going on right now and shaking it requires help and confronting the shit that makes you believe alcohol will be the solution. 1 year while still craving is absolutely insane btw.

We are all reliant on others. Almost nobody can get sober by themselves. I am also someone who can't do the whole god thing. I can ignore that part and take in the rest, but I never worked any of the 12 steps knowingly. I know some of the things I did in recovery fit the 12 steps, but they didn't guide me. I used the local AA group in the beginning to talk about my situation, but didn't return after about 6 months. I will be 10 years free from alcohol in October though. AA was just one piece of the puzzle. Your sobriety requires extra work, especially mental work. But you don't need anyone judging you right now like some of the comments here. I'd recommend trying groups you haven't tried before. Apparently they're all different and maybe there's one out there that works better for you. I found a small local NA group that's fantastic. You can go there as an alcoholic. SMART seems to be great for people who just can't do spirituality or religion, like me.

I've tried going to programs but for the most part everything in my area is faith-based. And I go so far as actively separating myself from religion. Not to disparage anyones faith; Above all I believe in leaving people to enjoy their lives in however which way they choose provided it doesn't harm others.

jg3vuwu,"Your sponsor(s) sound unhinged. Unfortunately I've seen recovery teach things like this in some places and I'm sorry you were told that and its not true. I am also in AA and we have the same questions (e.g. ""what was my part""), but the answer for my resentments about abuse or sexual abuse I received has never and will never be that it was my fault. I was taught to find ""my part"" in my resentments so I can see my way to letting it go. Not because those people deserve forgiveness but because I deserve peace. I was then taught that ""my part"" was hanging onto it. A lot of my part was my expectations. I expected people to act a certain way, or know better, and because they didn't or didn't want to - I received abuse in some way and was massively resentful. In a perfect world people would know better, but this isn't a perfect world. It helps me to remember there are expectations people have had of me that I couldn't meet either. In early recovery I still held the same expectations but learned to let my expectations of other and the people who first hurt me as a child go. What I can do now instead is to stop expecting people to know or act better, and instead be honest with myself about the reality of the world and take steps to take care of myself, like setting boundaries and not continuously putting myself around people that hurt me. E.g. if I'm friends with someone who continuously says hurtful things to me, my resentment towards them and the pain they cause me is not justified because I expect them to know better and be better, it is dangerous to my recovery. It is my responsibility to accept that they are sick people who probably need some kind of help, but it doesn't have to be mine. It is my responsibility to remove myself from people like that, and continue to keep myself away from them, and to treat them with cordial kindness (unless they do something illegal then 100% call the authorities. If someone told you otherwise ask to see the AA safety card). As recovery went on I was able to build health(ier) relationships with family members who mentally and emotionally abused me as a child. Now I see that they too were abused as children, and were never given help and taught they didn't need the help they so desperately needed, so they passed it on to me. My resentments overall for them not being better parents is gone, and occasionally it crops up when I have expectations that ""they should know/do better"". Right now I'm in a place though where I have been grieving that I will never have the healthy and supportive parents I wanted growing up, and that while I may never get healthy love from them I have a lot close friends in recovery who have been able to show it to me.",1681401045.0

jg3fu7j,"Your description of your current reality reminds me of the time I quit alcohol. Being at an incredibly low point in life such as where you are right now makes it unspeakably difficult to see any resemblance of hope or positive outlook into the future. Every single thing you feel, everything you said in your post is not just normal, but to be expected after 9 years of self-numbing. The fact that you are still here and now actively looking for support shows that you are a lot stronger than you think. I want to tell you that you have started on the correct path. Almost no human being is able to escape serious addiction on their own, without outside help. Going to NA first and now to rehab shows me that you are not lost at all. You cannot feel hope for yourself right now, but what you have done already makes me believe in you. > Only 3 months ago I started going to NA and noe in 2 weeks oficially rehab. I'm proud of you. That's the way. Don't drop it. Never hesitate to go back. It's not easy, but it's good for you. > I feel like a mindless braindead failure of a animal that just exists and takes up resources. This was me for the last 2.5 years while abusing stimulants. I consisted of jerking off and playing video games. 3 months into my sobriety I miss the speed wanks and I don't even feel the shame you feel right there. Not sure if that's better or worse, but saying it like that makes it sound as fucked up as it is. > I have nightmares EVERY singukar damn day to the point i cant even fall asleep of these thoughts. This is one of the main reasons I've been using different substances for about 23 years. To help me fall asleep and to escape the negative thought circles/intrusive thoughts. These thoughts and feelings are always the most intense at the lowest points in life. That's why it sucks so fucking much for you right now. But there is a way out and you have already started walking it. Rehab is a fantastic step, I'm really proud of you. I was so fucking scared of my first inpatient psychotherapy. That was 18 years ago. Without that I'd probably have been long dead already. > But here is where I am. And the reason I kept using then for so long. You speak with a lot more clarity and self-reflection than you probably realize. This is the way. Say the things that trouble you. Speaking them makes them more real. The more you seek and accept help, the more you open up, the more honest you become, the better your recovery. But you do not have to be perfect. None of us is! Remember: Most recoveries have setbacks in some form or another. The path ahead of you is not easy, but you have the power to walk it, whether you believe it or not. Fear is part of the process. Doing it anyway is where you will find real, serious progress. Keep it up, my friend. I'm rooting for you. Whenever you need us, we will be here for you. > I keep on being told hoe intelligent I am by every psychologist or therapist i go to but at the end the more sober i become the more i feel suicidal cus of these thoughts. Hah, yeah. I was told all my life how ""smart"" I am. Not really helpful, because it makes me feel like I'm supposed to beat this because I'm better than everyone else or something like that. Yeah, maybe some of my thought processes are pretty decent, but being smart alone will not be enough for recovery. It is correct to build you up though, and I assume that was their intention. When you're at a low point in life like that, every single kind word can be a helpful push in the right direction. Every empathetic comment gave me a flicker of hope. I think that's what your therapists were going for. I know how it feels to be considered intelligent while having a head full of destructive chaos and no fucking idea how to tackle any of the multitide of problems you're facing. What you need to learn from scratch is how to treat yourself with more kindness. The negative thought circles were always accompanied with self-hatred, and that's poison for your mind. You will not be able to just push a button and lose that self-hatred. Working on that is a process that takes time. And it feels silly or downright dumb or even insulting at times, because you sometimes need to tell yourself things that the addict part of your brain does not believe or want to be true, like ""I don't want to use anymore."" That little tidbit is not even true to me right now, in my 3rd month of recovery, because my addict brain still desperately wants to use. It's my reality right now. But I am feeding the other side now, and as a result, the addict brain has begun to shrink. Find a mantra. Something like ""I can do this. I can get through this. I have felt worse before and I will feel better soon."" or whatever fits the voice inside you that desperately wants to get healthy. Say these things to yourself, every single day, even if you don't believe them or feel dumb doing so. And do not allow yourself to disagree. If you do, disagree back. That's your addict voice trying to take back over, because it's starving. What gives me the most hope for you is that you're only 24. You are still able to bounce back. 9 years is a long time, but you have a much longer way to go, and it is very, very possible to turn into a different person. I started my first real job at age 31 and have now been working for longer than I was unemployed. I have overcome pretty much everything that was still holding me down at your age. I was in deep shit until 29. No matter how long your path of self-destruction, recovery is always possible. And your brain is not as fried as you think it is. Give it time. 3 months. A year. 5 years, whatever. Even my brain is not as fried as I thought it was just 3 months ago, when I was near the end of my 2.5 years long stimulant abuse.",1681394740.0
jg3a7ue,"I’ve had similar problems with 12-Step programs. This is why I prefer Recovery Dharma. In my experience, the people in Recovery Dharma meetings are much more empathetic, affirming, open-minded, and are often people who didn’t fit in with (or had problems with) 12-Step. Personally, 12-Step does not meet my needs enough to even motivate me to want to give back. In a lot of ways, 12-Step made me much more miserable and ashamed. Recovery dharma does meet my needs, and frankly, I see through 12-Step programs bullshit so easily now and I am so glad I escaped it. I can now go to 12-Step meetings and take them for what they’re worth, and at the end of the day it always helps to hear others in recovery share. I am also grateful for a lot of what I learned in 12-Step. I personally think it’s a program for the easily-indoctrinated or the already-indoctrinated. The toxicity that is native to 12-Step meetings is a lot like the toxicity that plagues churches that I grew up in. When I gradually stopped going to 12-Step, I realized a lot of fears the program instilled into me were highly irrational. Also similar to when I gradually eased out of the church. All in all, there is way too much parallel between 12-Step and the church, and I feel like in both, the idea of being free is to live in a prison of beliefs that you never have to leave. I don’t feel free when I’m in that setting, I feel confined and constricted, which makes me want to liberate myself. I don’t want to be in a program that makes me feel the need to be liberated (because the first thing my brain goes to when it craves liberation is drugs). I want to be in a program that makes me feel free, in touch with myself, in touch with reality, supported by others instead of judged by others, and ultimately helps me grow from my journey instead of growing from fear.",1681392312.0

jg2og44,"I'm really sorry you went through that and are experiencing this reaction. I have also experience abuse. It was never your fault or mine. I got very defensive when I was first asked to think about responsibility and I think its because it was phrased so badly. I am not responsible for what happened to me as a child. I was a child. It was not okay. I can react differently now. This reading helped me understand things a bit better - Recovery is a process that each individual must be ready and willing to work on to be successful. Taking ownership and having a sense of personal responsibility are both key factors of successful recovery from trauma or addiction. Accepting personal responsibility for the recovery process is also one of the signs that a person is truly ready to begin healing. You may feel defensive when hearing about taking responsibility and ownership. After all, circumstances leading up to addiction and trauma are so complex and have multiple causes. How can we take responsibility for things that are not our fault? Are we not victims suffering from the actions of others that triggered our traumas and addictions? Taking ownership of recovery does not mean you are responsible for events that may have happened to you. Ownership simply means that you have the power to not let those events bring you down again in the future. The “Blame Game” Why is the “blame game” so detrimental to those in recovery? Blaming transfers the responsibility of our behaviors onto others. When we assign blame, we are merely inhibiting ourselves from creating solutions that lead to recovery. For example, maybe you began drinking after being laid off. “Downsizing was to blame for my drinking, not me!” When taking personal responsibility, however, the blame game is not useful. Blame disempowers us from finding solutions because we are not correctly identifying the problems. Taking ownership of our recovery means accepting the circumstances for what they are. Even if being laid off wasn’t your fault, it still happened. So what will you do with these new circumstances and challenges? Identifying the Problem When bad things happen, we need to first identify how the event affected us. In the example of being laid off, our source of income was taken from us unexpectedly. Our routine was shaken up, our social relationships from work were disrupted, and we now feel like we have no reason to get out of bed each day. These problems are real and severe. Losing a job can impact so many aspects of our day-to-day lives. For those of us who struggle with addiction, an event like this could trigger alcohol or substance use. Blaming others, however, serves no purpose to us — it only disempowers us. Blaming takes away our time and energy to fantasize about changing circumstances beyond our control. When we scatter our energy toward blaming others, we give others all the power. When we play the blame game, we begin to feel that the world is a cruel and unfair place. The problems that we can resolve, however, are what the bad event caused — not the event itself. We cannot change the past, but we can build our resolve by taking responsibility for our current circumstances. For those recovering from traumatic events, remember that while you cannot change what happened to you, you can resolve the feelings and deal with the impact the event has had on our lives. There is hope for change and improvement. Empowering Ourselves by Finding Solutions Once we realize the problem is not the event itself, but the effects of the event, we can begin to take ownership and responsibility for recovery. Blaming gives the responsibility to others: “If they hadn’t fired me, I wouldn’t be dealing with this!” Ownership, however, gives us our power back. Once your attitude progresses from blaming to accepting, you can begin finding solutions. Identify how the event affected you, instead of focusing on the event itself. For example: “I was laid off and now it’s my responsibility to find a new source of income. What are some solutions? Perhaps I am eligible for unemployment compensation to help me in the short term. I can update my resume and search for new jobs. I can ask friends or family if they have chores I can help with for extra cash. I can sell some items in my home I no longer use. I’ll get through this.” It’s easy to fuel and justify the cycle of addictive behavior by blaming others. Empower yourself by accepting what has happened and learning how to overcome the problems presented by the event.",1681379471.0

I just want to say that without any questions at all that what OP experienced was horrific abuse and his sponsor was full of shit when he used those passages or concepts to place blame for the abuse on you. This is something that is unfortunately too common, but it is a misreading of what the texts say and the directions for working through steps and inventories. Many of us have serious problems other than alcoholism/addiction. The texts continually tell us to seek out proper medical and psychological help for such conditions and to be quick to see where medical people and spiritual people are right. So e people in 12 step groups will tell you that they have replaced medical support with their 12 step affiliation. If they tell others to do the same then they can fuck right off. That is dangerous and damaging advice. And attitudes like that are what lead medical people and psychologists to find that ""AA does not work"" or ""12 Step Programs Don't Work."" Whether the programs work or not, they definitely don't work if people start making shit up that is not even part of the program. Or they don't actually read and study the texts and try to do what they say.

They could be shockingly harsh at times but there were almost always 100% correct in their harsh assessments of my reality. Now that I am getting to be an old timer, I don't do that. Even though it ended up being growthful for me, there were some pretty serious resentments that came out if that and I have decided not to carry that tradition forward. I would not change that for anything as it helped me to build up a foundation of accountability and rigorous honesty which was extremely necessary for me. But I think there are other ways to communicate corrective suggestions these days. I have mixed feelings about it, not gonna lie. However, even those old timer types were sponsored to say things like ""I can't help you with that"" and ""that is outside of my experience."" In OP's case I do not share that experience but I do have a close family member who tried to kill me several times and was extremely psychologically and physically abusive to me when I was very young. ""My part"" in that is Jack shit because I was a baby and a toddler and I should never have been in those situations with that person. Miraculously, that person and I have a close and loving relationship because honestly, I don't know how, but it is through working the 12 steps and it took some time to get to where we are today. And both people needed to come to terms with a lot of shit and engage in significant healing and etc on our own in order for that to become possible. That was not the only abuse I experienced and I don't get into too many unnecessary specifics and I certainly don't try to ""out trauma"" anybody else in 12-step or recovery programs because there is always somebody who has gone through way worse crap in one way or another. But I will say that ""my part"" in the story of my abuse is that I was taught wrong and taught that there was something fundamentally not right and unlovable or intolerable about myself. That was honestly the very worst damage of my abuse: What it did to my own self image. I was able to heal from that most meaningfully after I had done a very thorough 1st , 2nd, and 3rd step, which was not my first time through, by the way. I had an understanding of a loving higher power who accepted me unconditionally and I had a sponsor who was able to go through that with me and model that unconditional love and acceptance. The remainder of my time in recovery I have had that kind of much more gentle but also rigorous sponsor. Today neither of is is quite as strict as we needed to be 15 or so years ago. . I also have switched from one widely known fellowship to another widely known fellowship. This was just something that happened kind of naturally and is not about one way being better than another. It is just something that gradually happened for me and has worked in my situation. I am not one who will sit in a meeting it fellowship group and pick apart what other groups have not done well. I take what is helpful for me and try to share the message with others. It has proved to be a wonderful way of life for me. OP I am really sorry that somebody got accountability so very wrong with you. It was harmful and painful and I hope you can find some healing.",1681359692.0
jg1uzc3,"I’m sorry someone told you that you have any amount of blame to carry for that shit. That’s bullshit and wrong on so many levels. I wouldn’t blame you one bit if you never got back to AA after that experience. I personally think there is far more grey in the world than the picture that’s painted in AA. “Everything is your fault” is bullshit. My sponsor told me that maybe my part was only that I’ve held onto it. That sometimes we aren’t to blame for the things that happen to us, just what we do after. At the time, that was helpful for me. I also understood that she isn’t a god or a trained therapist, so she was doing her best to help me through my shit and it’s possible she didn’t get it right. We do need to take responsibility for our behavior, for example, I personally was perpetuating the cycle of abuse I had experienced in some ways and needed to own that. But today I can understand that the wounds of trauma laid the groundwork for a life of toxic behavior and that I don’t need to keep engaging in it. Bottom line is no one should have implied that you were any way at fault for the abuse you endured. That’s not cool at all.",1681357490.0
jg1rijr,"I left an approving comment on your original post, but it bares repeating here: THANK YOU for vocalizing so loudly and articulately the harm AA can cause to the new and vulnerably sober. Too much of the critique of AA—if it’s tolerated at all—is kept to some polite version of “different strokes for different folks” or “works for some and that’s great.” The problem of this is that AA is perceived—by most of society, but certainly by those new to to sobriety—as the ONLY option. In many places, including my major metropolitan city, it almost literally IS the only option for in-person meetings. And of course, the people at AA will insist that it’s the only option. So if it feels shame-y to you? That’s your fault. And you’re extra fucked because “the only option” didn’t work for you. In fact, don’t they open every meeting with a warning about people like you? Who the program doesn’t work for? The truly hopeless? I had been trying AA for months, felt so intensely judged and shamed there, witnessed behavior that made me wildly uncomfortable… but I bought the line that I just “needed to try more meetings.” After 30-50 meetings—sharing, voicing my confusion and discomfort, genuinely seeking advice—I was routinely told I was bringing those feelings on myself. I was doing that. I hadn’t even started the program, and I was being told I was doing it wrong, just for having doubts. If you’re new and scared about sobriety, as I was and still am, that shit makes you feel alone and hopeless. “Trying different meetings” cost me months of not finding compassionate help.",1681355661.0

Some of the problems related to addiction cannot be satisfactorily addressed that way, and require outside help. NA is but one tool for addressing addiction, not the only tool.

In no way was it ever suggested I have a role in the abuse that I endured. In fact, I leaned how to let go of the guilt and regret I’ve held onto. I assumed much of the blame and consequences I faced and it’s stayed with me all of my life until I worked the steps and shared my experiences with others and a sponsor I trust.

I agree with you that AA alone is not appropriate for healing trauma, at least in my case. Like you say, they are so intertwined, and AA tends to get pedaled as a cure-all when it’s not.

jfyfxmy,"Yes! Absolutely! I'm not going to lie, it's going to suck at first, so your best bet is definitely getting professional treatment (inpatient treatment) and listening to your counselors recommendations. If they recommend going to a long term rehab do it. The longer you're away from where you were using your drug of choice and your drug of choice the better. If this isnt feasible I would definitely recommend getting into a self help program immediately. The 12 steps are great - alcoholics anonymous and narcotics anonymous but they aren't the only ones that exist. And you don't have to believe in God to be part of them. But there's also SMART recovery which takes a completely different approach (self management) Dharma recovery which incorporates meditation into their meetings and much more. The meetings are great in the beginning because they will take up time and give you something to do when the cravings get bad and a way to network and meet other sober people. It's something a lot of people continue with to maintain their sobriety but everyone is different. Oh and they have them in person or you can attend them through zoom! I'll put links below.

But we can say that we’re abstaining for today. As for the hole that not using has left, my experience was that doing a 12 step recovery program helped, particularly working the steps, getting in harmony with my higher power and making good friends who are clean (which took going to meetings to meet these people) But that wasn’t enough on its own. I needed psychiatric help (meds + therapy), I needed a brain rebuilding diet, I needed exercise, a strong sleep regime, I needed meditation. And it still took a couple of years to not feel that hole anymore. A couple of years that I did day by day, not tripping on tomorrow.

jftreeq,"Germany here. Together with our brothers and sisters in the US, we got all timezones covered, hah. I was up until 5am last night. It was just one of those nights. I filled it with reading, writing, and hopefully long-term growth. Alcohol was different to me in that I found my rock bottom. Quitting was comparably easy at that point. I had known for a decade that I was drinking too much. Speed... does not seem to have a rock bottom. I can't see one so far. I had been thinking of trying to find help for a year before actually making the first step. Of course I felt the ongoing destruction, but I'm pretty sure there's a lot more of my brain to take away before I finally die. And on the way there I'd feel artifical happiness all the way to the end. But, yeah, I do have quite a few accomplishments I can be proud of in my adult life. Alcohol and cigarettes were big. Finding long-term employment after a decade of unemployment. I've basically turned into a completely different person from age 20 to 40. Well... aside from the drugs. And right now, my addict voice is trying to convince me with arguments like ""Life has thrown everything it can at you and you're not just still standing, you flourished. You beat alcohol, nicotine, unemployment, and your ego. Everyone will expect you to beat this addiction too. Isn't it time you allowed yourself some leeway? Everyone is expecting you to win all the time, shouldn't you allow yourself to lose occasionally?"" It's quite possibly the most manipulative shit I've ever experienced in my life.

Her goal is to get you healthy so that she can love you the way she walkways dreamed, but there is no book on how to do that and especially when your baby is suffering and on the brink of death.

Tactics where they lie daily to my facr and take over control of my own life because they see me as a idiot child and think im not responsible to have control over my life. This tactic only severly worsens my situation. And thats whats been happening forna decade now. And gues fucking what What do we do after 10 fucking years of this tactic not working? WE DO IT FUCKING AGAIN. Even harder this time. Its for his own good. Unfortunetly im so suicidal these days in my head becwuse of their way of thinking that they have complete control over me that i feel like its pointleas to fight any.ore. Anything i do im wrong. They are literally always the right ones. Everything they do is justified and nothing i do is right. I want to die. Daily. The only thing thats holding me on is that it will hurt people around me.

If you manage it now, it's a win and you can draw energy for your next battle with addiction. Maybe trying to remember how you felt when deciding to give it a try can help as well, try to remember your wake up call, talk to people you're close to about your problems, maybe go to meetings, every little thing can help, but I think that you need to use the momentum while it's there. Second, regarding your psychological problems, talking can really help, but it might just not be enough. Antidepressants aren't ideal, but they can be a good tool, if you need them. They aren't magic, though, they might gradually help you, or not at all, as finding the right ones is pretty much experimenting (it's not only them working, it's also them working for you, as their side effects can be a bitch). But you still need to work through your issues, talking about them, working on them. You might also need to find the right therapist for you, having tried three doesn't mean that any one of those was the one for you. Being stubborn can also benefit you, you need to find a way to turn the stubbornness the right way.

And then, either no one would show up, or they would show up and just tweak on their phone, or get paranoid, or whatever. And even if sex did happen, it wouldn’t be much good, nothing at all like what I was hoping for. Meth is a fucking liar. I’ll also say that I’ve been doing this drug for well over twenty years.

So you’re already doing something to help yourself right now, just by using writing and sharing as a means of processing. I honestly can’t really try and give you specific advice without knowing more about your drug use and more about the situation (ie do you have the means to get away from your family and seek treatment, or are you more or less stuck with them?). But my general advice would be to cut out as many triggers as you can, no matter how much it might hurt, and then seek whatever type of assistance might be available. To help challenge your thoughts, a cheap and easy way to do it is with Woebot or a similar CBT chat app. I could offer some more suggestions but I’d need to know your DOC. Anyways, I’ve been there too, and I’m sober now. It isn’t impossible, not matter how fucked you may be now. You’re still alive so you still have a chance.

jfa0v88,"I’m going to have to strongly disagree with pretty much everything you just said aside from some basic facts about the dopaminergic pathway. 1)your initial note about all psychiatric drugs operating via the same mechanism as most drugs is something you just made up I guess. SSRIs, for instance, are called that being they prevent serotonin re uptake selectively, and as such increase the levels of serotonin in the brain. Serotogenic psychiatric drugs do not operate primarily via the dopaminergic pathway, because… obviously they don’t, There can be interactions, but not all psychiatric drugs universally have the same mechanism of action as typical drugs of abuse. There’s also the GABA pathway. 2) It’s absurd to assert that there is no such thing as comorbid factors, or prior environmental effects/trauma when it comes to drug use. If your theory about these thoughts occurring only because of a rewired dopaminergic pathway was correct, then relapse would not exist for those with enough time to have effectively healed their reward system. 3) It’s even more absurd to suggest that there is literally no potential for benefit from any sort of mental health intervention while one is currently using. Even if that were strictly true, it would still be stupid, dangerous advice, but leaving aside the harm reduction potential - how in the world are you under the impression that it’s not possible to do anything whatsoever to help yourself prior to cessation of use? Something doesn’t have to become a “belief” for it to be useful, and forming beliefs isn’t a process mediated exclusively by the dopaminergic pathway, anyway. 3a) ( 😂) You can learn coping mechanisms, you can learn various techniques that aid in either using less, and you can learn things and practice things that can range from simple harm reduction to changing your response to the type of thoughts that can plague people with mental illness and SUD. (Among many other things). … medication and therapy are blocked from working because the drugs are bullying them off the dopaminergic path? WHAT?

jf7gmiu,">But I am aldo severly psychologically unstable (spent 2 years constantly going to psychotherapists and on 6 different meds including antidepressants) and all that help just does nothing A think to note on this - all psychiatric medication is massively subverted by illegal drugs. Illegal drugs operate on exactly the same pathways as psychiatric medicine (cocaine is technically an SSRI, for example). What's more, dopaminergic drugs render therapy impossible because the link between reasoning and the formation of beliefs is completely broken - therapy requires you to be able to reason ""x"" and then get the corresponding emotional drive for ""x"", but if you're abusing dopaminergic drugs (which is all of the ones you can get addicted to, and I guarantee the ones you use) nothing you reason in therapy is going to become a corresponding emotional drive: your brain is quite literally rewired to form whatever beliefs justify more drug use. >Thats one of the main reasons ive been using drugs. Cus everything isbso famn painful. Wrong. You feel this is the reason, but that's what makes drugs addictive - they make you feel that you have a reason to use, but that feeling of ""I have a reason to use"" is a symptom of the drug. Dopaminergic drugs are addictive because they make you form completely real, hyper-potent beliefs that they ""help"" with the very problem they're actually causing. If you feel that you need the drug to help with pain, the drug is actually creating the pain. You feel the way you feel because every time you think ""I'm sad and in pain"" you take the drug, but then the drug's dopaminergic action forces the belief ""I'm sad and in pain"" to become more potent and repeat, because that's the effect dopaminergic drugs have on the brain. Each time you take the drug, it forces you to more firmly believe you're in pain, and of course it is believing that which creates the pain: no matter how much you feel the drugs are helping, they are actually the cause of your pain. You need to do everything in your power to stop taking drugs. Medication and therapy are of zero use to somebody who is actively using drugs: the very thing both of those act upon works completely backwards when a person is using dopaminergic chemicals.",1680800276.0

Our job is to be caring, compassionate, and kind to the residents that come through all while maintaining boundaries and a sense of professionalism. Our goal is to gain trust with these people so they are encouraged to stay in the program and open up to us on one level or another. Someone above mentioned not being a stickler for the rules. Please do not take this advice. You dont have to be a stickler and there are kind ways to be assertive but at the end of the day our rules are in place to keep both the staff and the clients safe as well as help set a foundation of routine and structure for the addicts that walk through our doors. They also somewhat assist with the boundaries that need to be placed given our roles. The program that i work for is a residential. The clients that we have spend about 8 hours at the clinical center doing group and then are transported by staff to a house that they stay at while doing the 28 day program. I am a tech at the house, so my shift is 330 pm to 1130 pm. One of the biggest difficulties that i have faced is push back from clients that dont want to maintain their bedrooms and the house in general. I have found the best way to assess this is to show them that you are not asking them to do anything you wouldnt do. So help them, tackle the tidying as a team and it really helps to motivate them. Other than this, I listen and i only give feed back and my experience when it is asked of me. I have no problem sharing my experience, strength and hope with the addict that is still suffering but we are not in this for me. I also personally chose to wait until I had 2.5 years clean before making this decision. For me the choice was solely based on the fact that I have witnessed too many people in recovery become victim to the burn out OR they felt that working in recovery would be THEIR recovery.

jexkgjj,">All because i feel i deserve it, my addiction seems to be self sabotage, in any form This is a big problem - this says ""drugs are inert - they're just enjoyable things, it's merely how I choose to use them that's the problem"". That is categorically not how drugs work, in fact it's backwards: the drugs you use are dopaminergic, meaning that they trigger the chemical process of belief formation with their action on your dopamine system. Normally a rising dopamine level would only occur once at the formation of a new belief, in response to you perceiving that something of value had happened. Drugs force that process to occur every single time you use, meaning that whatever belief you were operating under at the time you took the drug is chemically forced to feel true, no matter how much the evidence of your senses disagrees. This dopaminergic action is completely invisible - it has no feeling associated with it and is unrelated to the drug's primary effect (which is the part you do feel). So when you say ""I'm self-sabotaging with drugs"" that might feel true, but the drugs created that feeling - in actuality, you took drugs which caused you to form beliefs that made you self-sabotage. If you think ""I'm behind and the drugs will help me catch up"", then you take a drug, the dopaminergic action of that drug will force the belief ""I'm behind and need to catch up"" to feel more true. Pretty soon, nearly 100% of the feeling is generated by the belief-enhancing drug, meaning that the drug is the reason you feel behind, and of course each time you feel that way you take the drug. All kinds of disasters and forms of pain can make you stop taking drugs for a time, sometimes forever, but to actually recover and be 100% free of the urge to use, you need to comprehend that the drugs cause the very beliefs the drug user thinks they're helping with - the idea that the beliefs came first is an illusion, a chemical manipulation of the drug itself.",1680623936.0

I really think that I'm in a place where I'll be able to stay off of drugs this time; before I had a reservation, due to the fact that I was young and I still had so little experience in life; even as I was clean for most of 7 years and 4 years consecutively, I always had a condition in the back of my head, that maybe I could control my drug use if I got into a place where I had a career and I was happy and healthy and stable, since I'd never been in that place before, and so once I got really far ahead and I had one little disagreement with my girlfriend, I decided to get high; I also hadn't been attending my NA meetings and I had been living kinda' unhealthy for a while, working too much. Now, I don't have that reservation in my mind, I've truly come to terms with the fact that I cannot use drugs successfully, and I'm excited to live my life now, recovered. I think hope is important, and a lot of people see this as an illness without the possibility of recovery, but I disagree; maybe I'm naive, but I really do feel like I've come to grow and become a person who doesn't need to lean on my addictive personality anymore. And no I wasn't taking oxycodone long term, only for the first 4 days in the hospital. After that, I kept relapsing, usually for 1-2 days every six weeks or so, over nine months, until July 14th; since then I've been clean for 8 1/2 months, and I'm just about to start tapering off of my methadone . I can tell you while methadone obviously doesn't have the same effects on the mind as total sobriety, I've also had sustained periods of sobriety, mot of my adult life, and I feel that methadone completely removing all of my cravings while also making me want to be clean more than ever has had a profound change on my perspective, and possibly my neurochemical makeup. I have read that people who have sustained clean time on methadone before tapering off have a higher probability of staying clean, and I think I can see why now; it's hard to explain, but I feel that, at 29 years old, I'm at a crossroad in my life, and I think my path forward is very clear :)",1680460853.0

You should be \SO\ proud of yourself, and honestly I wouldn't get inpatient now, you're at then end of the ride :) I don't know if you read reply above, but a paper came out in 2017 that stated that people who have sustained clean time on methadone, who then taper off, for some reason have a much higher rate of sustained lifetime recovery. I believe it was hypothesized that the methadone causes a chemical change to the way that the body processes opioid, but regardless, I think it might be a good thing that your taper took a little bit longer because now, you might have the effect that helps you stay clean for the rest of your life :) I know I for one, for the first time in my life, have zero desire to use, ever. I used to use about 1/4 oz of pure black tar a week mixed with \~1.5 grams of meth a week, and the really amazing thing is I don't even have cravings for meth ever anymore! Part of the reason is due to my high dose and the fact that I'm a fast metabolizer, the last time I relapsed on meth, it literally made me puke immediately and gave me crippling stomach pains and over stimulation to the point that I couldn't even move for like 15 hours. I really think that experience was God breaking my meth addiction for me, because ever since, if I even start to think about meth, my mind instantly goes back to that experience and I feel sick to my stomach :) I'm grateful for the tough time I've had on methadone because for the first time in my life since I started using, I feel like i did when I was a kid before I had my addiction, it's really like a miracle.",1680456431.0

jej47tm,">I'm wondering what my priority should be. Rehab. Drugs directly undermine the very faculty that mental health treatment requires - the ability to reason and then form beliefs that accord with that reason. Dopaminergic drugs (which I guarantee are all the ones you were addicted to) quite literally force you to feel as though the belief that led you to use is true, no matter how much you reason against it or how much the evidence of your eyes tells you it is false. If you take a drug like alcohol on the belief that it helps you ""have a good time"", even if you become sloppy drunk, incomprehensible, fall over and hurt yourself, and cannot speak anything but nonsense, you'll still acutely feel the belief ""that helped me have a good time"" to be true. You see this chemical effect in people who use drugs all the time - they'll often sit around talking about how fun it was to get in fights, hurt themselves, get lost, not know where they were etc etc. Rehab is a form of inpatient mental health care. Everything that would happen in an inpatient facility will also happen in a rehab, except with the focus being on getting a substance that would definitely prevent a regular inpatient ward from being effective out of your body.",1680353117.0

jeix8kd,"I’m disabled and have chronic pain. The bad kind…CRPS. I currently have an outside issue (that I will not list here, but you may figure it out from the story). For 14 years I struggled with my pain and my determination to stay sober. I was lucky to afford the best doctors and PT’s and OT’s. I saw all the specialists I could and did exactly what they told me. Exactly… I saw it as an extension of my sobriety. The In Times of Illness pamphlet (you can read online) by NA was and IS my Bible. But at 14 years, I knew I had come to the end of my rope. Chronic pain patients die by suicide all the time. I sat each doctor down and told them it was time for daily medication that was not safe. They all had a big phone conference (my addictionologist included) and they discussed the plan. I knew I couldn’t take a daily opioid because I would relapse. I had come to the point where it was necessary to try something else for pain control. And so we did. But I made sure that I followed every suggestion, every Avenue for years until I had exhausted every route. I have no guilt nor do I feel like I’ve relapsed. So I guess the answer is wait 14 years? I joke…. Give the new medicine a try. Ask for the lowest dose possible if you are sensitive to meds (I ask this all the time and doctors always agree). Don’t expect miracles… expect better. Start therapy with someone who specializes in ADHD. Do your due diligence to make sure you are examining each Avenue. If the med helps 5%, and the therapist helps 8% and the meditation and mindfulness helps you another 5%… well, that’s 18% better already! I do want to add one thing… you have a neurological disorder. It’s real. Be gentle with yourself and your brain. Others won’t understand what you are really experiencing. I’m gonna suggest you look into Pills Anonymous meetings, because you will have a higher likelihood of finding other people like us. I also want to suggest making an insta profile just to follow fellow disabled content creators. That has made a huge impact in my life. I think you’ll find some solace and a lot of ideas there.

The disease hijacks the brain, and common sense and good judgment go out the window. Addicts/drinkers can't stop because if they do, they get seriously sick - even seizures. After a while it's not about the buzz, its about trying to feel ""normal"". Best not to approach the topic when they are under the influence, and not to confront in a hostile, screaming way. (I did all of this until I learned there are more effective ways of getting through). Talk with him when he is calm, and prepare what you want to say. Yelling and guilt-tripping do not work. I confronted my family member and said,you need help. I will find help for you. My family member immediately agreed and off he went to detox (safely tapering off meds to avoid seizures), and then to a 28 day inpatient program. We have been through his cycle at least 10 times but this last time worked. Your dad might not be ready to admit he has a problem, and that may take him hitting rock bottom, ie. his wife leaves him, he loses his job, etc. Hopefully he can recognize that he needs help. Get help for yourself, too. Look online to see where there are Al-Anon meetings in your area. There are even meetings online. Al Anon was a real lifesaver for me and my husband, and we learned tools on how to cope and keep our sanity. You will get strength and some peace of mind knowing you are not alone, and hearing others stories can help.All age people go, parents, sons, daughters, friends. This disease effects all of us. If you decide to approach your dad, do it when he is sober. Don't throw the drugs on the table and say ""what are you doing with these???? What is wrong with you??? (we did that. Not helpful) Keep the conversation short and to the point. ""Dad, your drinking and drug use is a real problem. You need help. I can help you find help. Hopefully he will be willing to go to a detox and inpatient program. He can't stop on his own and will just keep going downhill. It's important to remember that its not a moral weakness that he can't stop. It's an illness and he needs treatment to get better just like if someone has cancer, or diabetes. If he refuses to get some help, it's probably best that you move back with your mom. I don't want to come across as a know it all, preachy jerk.

I do not accept this is a valid reason to use right now. (I will often caveat very specifically to remind myself I only have to not pick up when I feel like picking up.

Keep asking questions until you get to the root of what the problem is, exactly, or as close as possible. When you figure out what you think is actually bothering you, ask what you can change about the situation; are these changes reasonable or practical; are there changes my wife could make that might also help to alleviate distress. Then you adjust. Adjust what you can, and then tell your wife specific (and reasonable) ways that she might help you to stay sober. It’s ok to set boundaries. It’s ok to ask for help.

jeekos1,"Accept Yourself and Your Situation: You must accept yourself and your situation to avoid relapse. Not denying your addiction or recovery. Accept your addiction instead of hiding it. Accepting your past will help you avoid repeating it. Understanding your wants and cravings requires becoming one with your mind. Reflect on your thoughts and addiction to better understand yourself. Keep a reflection notebook and practice mindfulness. Keep a journal. Know Your Triggers: Whether it's seeing someone else drinking or a party, knowing your triggers might help you avoid them. Writing down your drug and alcohol triggers is a fantastic method to identify them. So you can avoid relapse later. PIG, or Problem of Immediate Gratification, is the tendency to favor tiny, immediate pleasures over larger, long-term rewards. Understanding your Problem of Immediate Gratification might help you overcome and prevent relapses. The Abstinence Violation Effect is utilizing a little slip-up to explain a significant relapse. If you have one drink at a party, don't toss away your hard work. When you mess up, have a plan. Prepare for a slipup to reduce your likelihood of relapsing. Instead, you can start over and achieve abstinence. A balanced life is healthy and addiction-free. Avoid stress by balancing work and personal life. As long as you balance your indulgences with healthy activities like jogging or meditation, it's good to have a chocolate bar or pizza occasionally. Relapse prevention requires self-care. Self-care involves physically and psychologically taking care of yourself. To keep your body healthy, eat better or take up yoga. Maintaining mental wellness helps prevent relapse. Mindfulness and nature can improve mental health. Eating well Find a Life Direction: Whether it's a passion project or a desire to volunteer, having a life direction can give your days significance. Finding your passion and committing to it will help you forget your addiction and connect with yourself and others. Long-term goals prevent relapse. They organize and plan your life. Having a goal makes it clear how relapsing might harm your chances of succeeding. Creating a vision board can inspire and motivate you. Celebrate your successes, no matter how minor. Every victory, whether it's staying sober another week or controlling your party cravings, deserves recognition. Addiction makes recovery seem impossible to overcome. After recovery and sobriety, your journey continues. Always consider relapse. If it happens, being aware will prepare you. Relapse prevention methods are also available. These tactics should make it simpler to avoid relapse and have fun in sobriety.",1680269053.0

jee24qh,"my partner and i have been together for five years this july, and i'll be sober five years this october. one thing my partner says really helped them was learning to set boundaries for their own best interest instead of looking to control my behavior. early on it was the ultimatum - if you relapse again then we are done. they hoped that by setting such a penalty that it would influence my behavior and keep me from getting high, instead of setting such a boundary to protect their own mental and emotional health. folks say that it's a bad idea to be in a relationship in early recovery because all relationships, especially good ones, take a lot of work. and introducing the stresses of a relationship into an already stressful environment (early recovery) can sometimes be a bad idea. i think that my partner and i were lucky in the sense that we had known each other for almost ten years before we started dating. there was already a connection there to build on. we were also long distance for the first ~13 months i was sober and that was a big help for two reasons. one: we didn't have an opportunity to be stuck to each other 24/7. although we did meet halfway once or twice a month and had regular skype dates. two: we had to learn how to communicate and be honest with each other or else it wasn't going to work. communication was basically all we had 90% of the time. it also took some work because it can be really hard to be vulnerable. all this to say that it can be done. we have a house together, a cat and a dog, we're engaged, and we are expecting our first child in the fall. be honest with your partner and yourself, no matter what. that's always a good place to start.",1680258363.0

jecfxjl,"These are all symptoms of the drugs. Remember, drugs aren't addictive because they're enjoyable - the effect you feel is irrelevant in terms of addiction, for all drugs have a dopaminergic action separate from their primary effect. It is the dopaminergic action that makes you use drugs again \- this chemical mechanism simply causes you to repeat any pattern of thought that leads you to use drugs. You're showing all of the classic symptoms of that effect - you cycle through lots of unrelated negative thoughts such as ""I have no emotional support"", ""I'm a manchild"", ""I can't provide for myself"", ""I'm worthless"", ""I play video games all day"". You think these thoughts, then you take the drug, then the drug's dopaminergic action forces you to repeat that pattern of thought. If you think ""I'm worthless"", then you take a drug, your tendency to think ""I'm worthless"" gets stronger and you feel more worthless. The same for every other thought that you repeat. Because of this, the drugs are causing you to feel the things you're feeling. Without the drugs, those thoughts would not endlessly repeat - it is the chemical nature of the drugs making them repeat. The advice is simple - do everything in your power to stop taking drugs. You will never, ever feel better whilst you are taking drugs. Whenever you take the drugs your tendency to feel the very thing you took the drug to ""help with"" will get stronger.",1680221642.0

Got on a plane and everything. Made plans, anticipated the plans, and saw the plans out. I never thought I'd be here and couldn't even imagine it when I was still living in addiction.

je94t10,"Many drugs affect dopamine and dopamine affects the way we experience time. This could be part of the reason you forget things even the things you experienced as a child. Excessive long-term use of Benzodiazepines can cause Permanent damage to neural branches but some of those branches can be repaired over time. It really just depends on the person and the circumstances But there is really no test for individuals to determine what level of damage has been done. I spent 20 years doing everything from benzodiazepines to cocaine to ecstasy to inhalants to psychedelics et cetera. For a long time, I felt the way you do and I thought that things would never change and that I would never be able to get a good job or be someone who excelled at anything in particular. It turned out not to be the case though. Those symptoms mostly went away and I went back to school and got my bachelor's degree and now I am in grad school. I have a great job in an industry that I love working in And I don't think of those things anymore. I do still struggle with memory retention And finding the right words to say or write but largely I have learned more after I quit doing drugs than I did beforehand and I am definitely smarter than I was before. I'm not trying to make it about me but I can't think of a better example to give you. I suggest setting goals that are important and meaningful to you and then working towards those. Retention and attention will no doubt increase because you are doing something that you truly believe in. Not sure if this helps but I hope it does and my last thought is just to never give up man. It also sounds like maybe you have lost motivation in your life. That happens when we do not find purpose and meaning in the things that we are doing - at least that can be part of it. Maybe try doing some selfless things like volunteering or getting a job helping other people who have similar issues or who have been through similar things.

I highly recommend making sure that all doctors know you are in recovery and that only one doctor can prescribe narcotics (for me, this is my primary care doctor. If I have foot surgery, my primary care doctor is still the doctor who prescribes (and he consults the surgeon). Also, don’t keep them in your possession. Have someone else be in charge of them. Get a notebook and write down the day and time you take each pill. And most of all, remember that you are taking pain medication to lessen the pain, not to make it go completely away. But don’t be a hero either. This is a big surgery. Just follow directions from the doctors and be absolutely honest about what you are going through when it comes to the pills. I remember being in the hospital before a surgery once, and having an absolute breakdown, because I was so scared of the pills and the IV meds. I started crying and my nurse came in and found me a mess. If you don’t know, nurses are what make a Hospital stay palatable. That nurse asked around until she found another nurse who was an Al-Anon. The Al-Anon nurse came into my room and we had about a half an hour conversation about, what was going on in the decisions that were being made. It was a total God moment for me.

je2fvju,"It’s been a year and a week for me now. Getting off of Xanax definitely had some pretty substantial effects on me. I may not be a great example to use though, because I’ve got some severe anxiety disorders. I’ve had a problem with pacing ever since I quit. I’ll sometimes pace for hours at a time. It started 5 days after I got off, and I assumed it’d go away with time, but it hasn’t gone away entirely. It has decreased in length and frequency dramatically, but it does still happen. initially I was pacing for 9-12 hours a day the first month I quit, now it’s like an hour or two every now and then. I also still get full body twitches and some serious problems sleeping. But the actual withdrawals themselves have been gone for like 10 months now. I’m getting a psych evaluation next month because they think I have more serious issues than just panic disorder based on how I handled quitting Xanax. They think I’ve got OCD and drug related PTSD. Don’t get me wrong though. I do not regret quitting at all. I know my body is significantly healthier despite my severe anxiety issues, and I feel better knowing I’m not doing damage to my nervous system. Things are more clear, I don’t feel nearly as groggy and depressed. I have WAY more moments of happiness and clarify now. It was the best decision I made, and the worst was over after a month. And you are doing a WAAAYYYYY better taper than I did. I tapered from 1.5mg a day to 0.5th a day for one week, and then I went cold Turkey. I ran out of medicine so that was my only option. The way you’re doing it, I think your symptoms will be less severe. It is manageable, but for me the Akathisia was by far the worst symptom. It’s the reason I would pace for hours.

It wasn't until I finally started listening to suggestions and trying them, that I finally started to get it. Will every suggestion or program work for you? No, but you can't know that until you try. The biggest and most brave thing someone can do is just admit ""I need help and I can't do it by myself"". In that same regard, you have to love yourself enough to want better for yourself.

I did a lot of research into herbs and supplements help, and the following helped me - Ginseng - Black Seed Oil - Rosemary (I made a tea) - Magnesium (at night) Sleeping pills/benzos can help but never use them for more than a couple of nights because those type of drugs are even harder to quit than opiates. Some say loads of exercise helps, but I always found the main withdrawal effects was fatigue so I found it hard to exercise.

jdz1ocm,"I rely on mine; but here's the thing- a Higher Power does NOT have to be a deity or any sort of a supernatural force. It needs only meet two criteria: 1) Can you control it? If you can, it can't be a power higher than us. It's got to be bigger than us. 2) Is it a force for good? I mean, if it's not, why do you want to be involved with it? That's pretty much it. This can take a myriad of forms. For many, the 12 step group itself is their higher power. It is bigger than them, and it is a force for good, so it does pass the test. In one of the comments here, Redditor r/skrulewi gave a great example of a Higher Power many wouldn't recognize, but it is, and it works for them. skrulewi said: >For most of the first few years, my higher power was the concept: ""Can you admit to yourself that you might be mistaken?"" I just repeated that shit over and over in my head whenever the word god or the concept of higher power came up. This is a valid Higher Power. The question of ""Could we have done anything differently?"" looms over us all. We can't change that fact. This question is, therefore, greater than us all, thus passing the first part of the test. The way it was being used by this individual made it a force for good, turning it into, for this person, a very valid Higher Power. Hope that rant helps. One more thing before I go. I try to find and tap into as many Higher Powers as I possibly can. The more the merrier.",1679983516.0

jdyb75u,"Probably a pretty biased group to get a non biased answer from. Though there is no where really to get an unbiased answer truly when it comes to substance abuse, most generally speaking. I’d say even if you don’t want to just go. If you don’t think it’s a problem then go anyway as a way to get them off your back and then when you get out you can do reflection on wether or not you feel as if you are going to continue to use. If you don’t want to you won’t, but to appease them get a clear head and learn even a small amount while there and come out make a decision. Just go and don’t sit there along the way and say stuff such as when you get out you’re planning on doing anything again or not or whatever. Just to say you have some time with a clear head and you made a decision. Just out of respect for them I guess is to at least get clear headed and all intoxicants out and really reflect on it. I’d been in situations many times prior that might bare some resemblance, and not trying to sound like a dick but in my experience I had to say “What reason do I have not to go other than to do drugs or drink?” My thought is that they were letting me live in their house, I had no consistent work, I wasn’t in a career job that I would lose that was $40/hr. I didn’t have kids and I generally speaking had no responsibility except for a part time job that really didn’t matter. Even then most places make exemptions. I remember one time I was trying to go to college at a university non-community college place and told all my professors I was going to rehab and could I just take my exams now as it was 2 weeks left in semester and they let me. Now I failed 3 out of 4 but still every one let me do that, as similar to when 3 other direct family members went to rehab, all got leave of absence from their career level jobs. Working for the state prisons, working for major corporations & then working at a very good union job. That’s my advice is all, is what would negatively impact your life majorly, even just a minor amount that you could not go & how it would benefit parents/family/friends/relationships and if the amount it would help people around you compared to the “negatives” that you’d experience what would the right call be? You miss a job interview for a good job but your parents sleep better at night even if you don’t take it serious or plan on quitting due to the possibility that could happen just makes those around you feel better because they care. Which one outweighs which and the right answer is generally almost always obvious. Most often than not, picking the one where you keep your current job but everyone else is still sick with worry is the incredibly selfish one. Especially if you aren’t making 50mill a year and will lose it all and your family if you don’t stay. Even then in my mind it’s still wrong decision to not go but 🤷‍♂️",1679968801.0

It gets a little iffy with fentanyl being in the scene the way it is, because “going out to do some more experimenting” can be fatal. However, that’s what makes it an epidemic. If you don’t want to be sober, then don’t be. You’re not going to get sober till you’ve realized that drugs won’t work for you. Or maybe it will. Here’s what I would do: 1.) go to an AA meeting 2.) go to an NA meeting 3.) go to a dharma meeting 4.) go to a SMART recovery meeting you can find all the meetings in your local vicinity online And THEN make the decision as to whether you think you should go to rehab or not, and if not, decide if you are ready to get sober or not, and if not, pack your stuff and leave.

But before that nothing could take away my desire to use bc heroin was my only real friend and the only real relationship I had in life. Drug addicts and alcoholics may not be able to take away their desire to use. But we can at least be honest about who drugs are to us and what type of relationship we have with it. In a separate discussion, I think it is important to note why we are choosing drugs over personal growth. We know we are putting our minds on the shelf and checking out. I think it's bc a lot of us don't want to take the next step forward. Asking someone where they want to be in 10 years from now and ask them what they can do in the next year or two to get there is good.

Because I was hanging out with people who “partied” like I did, it seemed like what we were doing was common. lol, but I guess it isn’t so much. I got sober when I was 35, I haven’t touched alcohol since, and I still struggle with lesser substances…I was proper sober for a year and a half…but that’s a different (albeit important) story. Relapse happens sometimes. I’ll start by saying that you’re in good company: Some of my very favorite people are in recovery—they’ve gotten sober in varying degrees and maintained sobriety for varying lengths of time. You will meet some of the most hilarious—hilariously dark—individuals in the confines of a meeting. And one of my favorite things about people in recovery, and specifically in meetings, it is that you’re meeting these truly lovely people and they’re telling you all the ways they have been a piece of shit, and all the current new ways they’re being a bit shit, and they’re not making excuses or giving explanations. They’re just speaking aloud exactly where they’re at. There’s no need for the phoniness that can come with meeting new people…showing your best version and whatnot. You find yourself in awe of the person they are in front of you and who they’re telling you the kind of person that can be. It doesn’t align. It’s quite refreshing. And that’s not to say there aren’t phony people or assholes or simply terrible humans in The Rooms. There are. But there are a hell of a lot more cool people than there are awful or insufferable ones. Anyway. For me it was about the people. I built a little support network and when I had people I knew I could lean on, I started digging down into my shit. Which you’ll have to do at some point, and it’s beyond uncomfortable. You have what it takes to stop: the desire to stop. The willingness. And that’s all you need. You don’t even have to believe in yourself right now, you just have to believe that I believe you can do it. That a lot of us out here believe you can do it, and we believe that because we did it. Because some of us were going to die, and I’m not speaking hyperbolically. We were going to die and we couldn’t stop no matter how hard we tried, but then we did. And you can. And if you do exactly what you’re doing—being willing and reaching out to others, asking for help and talking about where you’re at in your “journey” [le sigh]—eventually you will absolutely believe in yourself.

I had a bad attitude about AA-thought it was basically Getting Sober With God and I didn’t grow up with religion so I didn’t see how it would help.

I sat in a lot of circles and listened to what other people were going through, and saw how they were going through life’s struggles soberly, and they were actually enjoying themselves. I tried to do the things they did that helped them not to pick up. I needed the meetings for the socialization. I’d say give that a try, but the answer is essentially don’t pick up, and go make some sober friends. and when you want to pick up, you pick up the phone and call those friends instead.

jdruafv,hey this hits home for me because its kinda what my girlfriend told me along time ago we were in recovery for almost 2 years together and then i got drunk so just like most addicts i went back to treatment at the time she was doing fine we had the bills paid and covered while id be gone at treatment. then about a month into my 90 day program she didn't call me and figured she had a bad day or something but little did i know she was reusing again and then she told me and a few days later she didn't call again. didn't think much about it and then my friends called asking about her and i told them to get my spare key and go check on her and she had overdosed while i wasn't there for her. but she was saying these same things right before she passed so please try and get some help ik you dont know me but i truly thinik everyone deserves to be happy. wish you the best of luck and if you need to talk im here too :),1679854784.0
jdrrv1f,"I'd strongly recommend simply going to NA. Although if one of your addictions is non-drug (I'm thinking gambling), it definitely couldn't hurt to also go to Gambler's Anonymous. The underlying biology of addiction is the same whether it's drugs or gambling, but the more specific the help the better, generally. That said, you don't really need to go to AA if you're doing NA - alcohol really is just ""a drug"" like any other.",1679853744.0
jdrew1o,"My primary substance abuse has revolved around meth. I’ve never had trouble with quitting or limiting alcohol, and can take or leave other substances. I have used sex addictively, especially in conjunction with meth and have a tendency to take other activities to excess, like work or exercise. I primarily identify as someone who’s in Crystal Meth Anonymous. My home group and sponsor are both in CMA. But I also have NA meetings I attend regularly. There’s a couple AA meetings I go to because I like those as well. When I’m there, I’m happy to identify as an alcoholic, based on the “When in Rome,” principle and I abstain from all substances including alcohol. My point to you is that the specific fellowship doesn’t matter much. Choose meetings with members whom you respect and get along with. Having a sponsor is incredibly important; once you find a good sponsor, they might dictate which fellowship predominates for you. But good recovery can be found anywhere. If you are an active sort, or want to be, check and see if The Phoenix _HYPERLINK_ is operating in your area. They aim at being an add-on to your recovery and are 100% agnostic about which path you follow in that regard. They arrange for things like hiking, CrossFit, yoga, or running groups that are free for people with 48 hours of clean time. They also have online resources. I’m greatly benefiting from including them in my recovery. Please note that they are NOT intended as a substitute for things like a 12 Step program. There are alternative programs out there. SMART recovery has been mentioned. LifeRing is a recovery model aimed at atheists and agnostics, or just those who prefer a model that excludes any reference to a deity. Celebrate Recovery is available at many churches and is an explicitly Protestant Christian approach to the 12 Steps. Some people will attend inpatient rehab and/or intensive outpatient programs. Often these will have ongoing therapy and support groups which can form part or all of their recovery model. I regularly attend an alumni group for my rehab as an add-on to my recovery which helps keep me in touch with other graduates of the program and helps me be of service to those currently in rehab. Finally, I’ll note that there’s a lot of truth to the saying that, “The opposite of addiction is connection.” You can find those connections anywhere. Recreation groups, including with normies, can be extremely helpful. I knew a guy who took up knitting with a bunch of old ladies: they’d sit around knitting and catching up with whatever was happening in their lives once or twice a week. It doesn’t have to be explicitly recovery based. Take advantage of your recovery to get back into some old hobbies or find new ones. Just make sure you do it live and in person. There’s no substitute for real life connections. This online stuff can be helpful, but it’s a pale imitation of actually being with other people. ______________________________  The only part that does matter is that NA uses its own literature, centered around its Basic Text, instead of the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. Most other fellowships use the Big Book. You may find that one or the other speaks better to you. But even here, things are fluid. I’m in CMA, which largely uses the Big Book, but my sponsor has me working out of the NA Basic Text and Step Working Guide. I’ve known AA sponsors who use the NA Step Working Guide with their sponsees. Recovery is recovery.",1679848279.0

Here’s the factual bottom line…she just lost her job a couple months ago, she & her roommate & best friend are barely speaking, her doggie passed away 2 months ago & crushed her, she has no insurance, no savings. She lives out of state from our whole family. Our dad has Alzheimer’s & is slowly slipping away. And she is in chronic pain with sciatica. Depression has hit her.

jdoxsl2,"What really clicked for me after ten years of trying, getting sober, and then going back to addiction something clicked. I hated myself and wanted to die. I realized if I can go through this agony of using, withdrawl and the shame, I can give sobriety a real try. Once I took drugs and alcohol off the table completely my life started to change. I no longer hated myself. I stopped going to the hospital for seizures and such. I could look at myself in the mirror. I started to be a good daughter and friend again. I became a wife and now a mother! My advice is give it some time and a real try. And your life will change in ways you couldn’t even imagine and then you would never even imagine going back to using! Even in the smallest ways, like clear skin and mind. Count your blessings, and even write them down if that helps! My other advice is try to replace your vice with something healthy. I know it sounds dumb. But think of something you can do when you are feeling like using. Preferably something that will also release dopamine. So things like: working out, laughing at comedy or with friends, for me unfortunately sugar 😆, doing some special self care whatever it is you like (for me it’s my nails), taking a pet for a walk or just time with your pet, doing art/journaling, reach out to someone and tell them that you feel like using and realize that being open and honest feels really good ( a lot better than hiding and hating yourself!) start a list of ways you have improved and why you are proud of yourself to look at in times of weakness. literally anything that can replace the action of cocaine and be at least a step in a better direction. So no drinking or other drugs to replace it 😉. You’ve got this, the first step is to admit you have a problem and have the want to truly stop!

jdn4ky9,"For me, the defining moment when I stopped relapsing regularly was when I finally accepted that drugs were off the table for me. I always had them in my back pocket, an “option” I could use as a last resort. That’s why I relapsed. One fuck-it moment and the last resort became the right resort. I had to truly accept that they were off the table, never an option, figure something else out. That acceptance I think is what has helped me accumulate 19 months of clean time. I have a ways to go in my sobriety maturity. Someone here pointed out to me recently that it’s addict thinking to believe drugs are good, fun, ok—just not for me. The reality is, they are bad and they actually change the way we think so as to make us use them. That was a bit of an eye opener. I am letting it percolate, as it feels like truth to my gut. I need to move past the “just not for me” stage of recovery into the “I don’t want them because they’re bad” stage. That might be true freedom? Idk. I hope this helps. 💜",1679764437.0
jdn4asm,Of course!! It’s so hard but it is so worth it! I feel a ton better after being off them for a bit. It has helped my quality of life and it has prevented me from relapsing with alcohol.

jdmimjn,"All 12steps / principles are the same, but may have different wording. The 12steps of AA greatly influenced the 12steps of NA. If you read the texts of both their 12step programs, you'll notice that the NA text follow AA's texts and principles pretty closely Where you may see a difference is in the wording, since the AA text was written in the 1930's and the NA text was written in the 70's (I think ). There may also be differences in the personal stories. AA's 12steps was heavily influenced by a contemporary religious group at the time of its writing, The Oxford Group. Legend has it that NA was founded because it's founder Jimmy K was told that speaking about his drug addiction in AA meetings was either not appropriate, or welcome, I can't recall the exact reason, but it falls into that scope, I believe. So, he founded NA, so that he and others could speak freely about their drug addictions and desire to free themselves of their obsessions to use. If you were my sponsee, I'd recommend sticking to 1 12step program, to avoid confusion and what we used to call 'analysis paralysis'. What's important is to stop using and drinking. Once you've gotten sufficiently clean / sober, then you can make a better, more informed decision about where you feel more comfortable sharing your own personal story.

That's far closer to ""I'm going to take my own dose"" than you might think. The doctors gave you a variable dose, then by all means take the smaller dose - you could even ask them if you can be given only the smaller dose, if that's working for you, but learning to take exactly what your doctors prescribe and seeing it as non-negotiable will help you navigate the situation you're in now, which is that you have to treat it like a regular drug.",1679740218.0

When I got into it, they wanted me to stop using while I did it and so I attempted to for 5 weeks to stop using on my own, I found that personally I couldn’t (everyone is different) and I broke down one day and after so many weeks of refusing to go into a rehab I agreed I needed the extra support to get clean. i went into rehab for 30 days and got out, lots of shit went down and my life changed completely, I myself found it was helpful going to NA meetings, again everyone’s different and everyone’s recovery looks different but its what has helped me, and I did another month in IOP. I gained so much experience in those three months of intensive care. Im forever grateful for it, if it wasn’t for the whole program of PHP I wouldn’t have had the chance to get clean in the first place and I honestly would probably be dead.

jdkonj9,"That’s exactly what I did and I LOVED it. I found it very beneficial to be in a therapeutic environment with people who understand my idiot brain without a lot of explaining, and who shared the common goal of sobriety. I met some of my dearest friends in rehab—people who are so completely different from me in almost every respect, and we are still very much the same. I loved it so much, in fact, that I continued to do aftercare for two years (and which is where I guess I technically made my friends). Good luck. Try to keep an open mind. When people invite you to join in their social bullsh (coffee, brunch, etc,) say yes. You might be very surprised. “Stick with the winners”, where you can, try to associate people who are actually trying to find and maintain sobriety. Not everyone in rehab is fully committed to quitting. Remember, you are probably more similar than you are different from your treatment brethren. Your brain will tell you that you are not like them: you’re different . And sometimes this is true, but mostly not. When you’re listening to others share And you’re feeling chippy and like “why the fuck do I care what this person has to say. Their story is nothing like mine,” seek the similarities-if nothing else, you’re both in rehab for your proclivities. I also find that when someone reeeeallllly gets under my skin for seemingly no reason, it’s often that I subconsciously something of myself in them that I do not like. So keep that in your pocket. Also, it’s ok to have bad days. It’s ok to feel irritated by a person you might feel isn’t “enough” of an addict. It’s ok to be mad at nothing. It’s ok to sit and listen when you don’t feel like sharing. Try to stay honest with where you’re at. If you feel like you want to use, tell the group. If you feel bad that you snapped at a clerk, tell the group. Talk as freely and openly about your emotions as you are able. Do everything you can to build your life in such a way that when you have a really shit day, You’ve got a list of people you can call, one after the other, to help you get to the other side of whatever discomfort you’re feeling in a moment.

jdkjcay,">Not that; that you still wanting it inherently means they are white knuckling it I think it has to - if you still want to take drugs, the only quantity that can prevent you from taking them is willpower. Expending willpower to stay sober, rather than truly not wanting to take drugs, is what defines ""white-knuckle sobriety"". It's only possible to be jealous when you see a person (or a cat) in a drugged state if you believe that state would be enjoyable. It's only possible to desire drugs if you believe those drugs were actually ""helping"" you rather than hurting you. It's possible for a person who believes drugs actually do provide benefits to still be sober - they can think something like ""I was using drugs to cope with my abusive childhood - I need to abstain from drugs in order to learn to cope on my own"". This belief sounds so reasonable, yet believing that necessitates the belief ""the drugs weren't actually bad - I was just in a bad psychological place"". Well, if you don't believe that the drugs were the cause of the problem there's no reason you can't take them, and if you enjoy the feeling of drugs you're now a white-knuckler - you crave the drugs, and even though every time you take them you get a bad outcome you never identify that the drugs were causing the problem, rather than simply being a symptom of it. You always say ""well it wasn't the drugs that caused my issues, it was my bad childhood/my abusive partner/my spiritual problem/my lack of faith in a higher power"". NA can unintentionally spread this state - you can end up with people who say ""I need to stop drugs because I have a spiritual problem - I'm a diseased person"". But once again, the idea here is ""the drugs aren't actually the problem - I'm the problem"". A person who thinks this way won't actually stop craving the drugs. This is not physical reality. The problem is not in the person it's in the drugs themselves - drugs are inherently harmful. Drugs are not taken because of spiritual problems - their manipulation of the brain creates spiritual problems. They never provided the benefit any of us thought they did - in fact, the belief that the drug was ""helping"" was actually just another symptom of its interaction with your brain's dopamine pathway, the part of the brain that exists to guide us towards things that ""help"". Even so-called ""moderate drinkers"" are all affected by the drug of alcohol - they're all consuming a poison whilst believing that need it to have a good time. That's a delusion - it promotes antisocial behavior and is the second biggest cause of cancer. The inherent harmfulness of the drug affects everyone, not just the so-called ""spiritually diseased"" addict. You can't crave something that you believe will cause your problem rather than solve it. No person tries to flap their wings to fly because they don't believe it will permit them to fly - you don't need to expend willpower to stop yourself from flapping your arms, and for the same reason it takes ""0"" willpower to resist taking drugs if you truly don't believe they're beneficial.

I was clean, but still in active addiction. I was as broken as when I stopped the drugs Now I'm back in meetings regularly. Talking to my sponsor everyday and working steps.

I'm learning to live and feel in my 40s. 20 years ago I accepted I was an addict and couldn't successfully use. This time I had to accept that I need to wake up and do the work everyday. I accepted that I can't do this alone. I've accepted that I'm truly the problem, and drugs were just a symptom of greater disease of selfish addiction Maybe you're different. I thought I was.

jdip1vv,"That's one of the problems with belief in god - there's always someone to blame. Instead of holding yourself accountable, you can just hold god accountable: when you choose to use drugs, it isn't because you decided to use, it's because you're ""losing faith in god"". When you need to think about how to adapt your life forward, you don't need to think about the realities of why you use, you don't need to ask hard questions like ""is this really helping"", you just do a little praying and say you're trying to find faith. That is one great flaw in NA - it makes the whole thing ""about god"", when the truth is recovery is about drugs. It's about the way drugs affect your brain, it's about the reasons you create for using drugs, and it's about the actual effect that taking a drug has on your life. It might time for you to kick that whole ""god"" thing and start asking yourself serious questions such as ""what effect does taking Kratom actually have on me? Am I happy when I take Kratom?

jdhz9p1,Yeah dude it definitely is and it was for me too. Microdosing mushrooms has helped immensely for my anxiety and depression. Anti depressants always just mask the problem. Anti anxiety’s always just mask the problem. With mushrooms you really figure out what makes you anxious and what is the underlying issue. It’s best to do it with a counsellor or someone that will help pull the info out of your brain.,1679670438.0
jdhxeuj,"I think it’s dumb. I’m tapering off methadone. The only thing that helps with withdraw symptoms and discomfort that I can obtain is thc & cbd. Does that make my recovery any less valid? After IV fentanyl use that nearly ended me, and two years clean from that, I think not. I’m stable, I have goals, I’m present for those who depend on me. That’s recovery. I used to have a drinking problem before opiates and tbh alcohol doesn’t appeal to me in the least, so I haven’t drank any in years. Edit- I’m not in any anon program and never have been since I got clean.

I'm not gonna bash NA (too much) because it's helped me and it's helped so many others. However, I too have gotten over it. I am still sober. I just hate it. So many personality disorders. So much testifying. So much unscientific nonsense. Yes, they are wrong about some things. Talking to group members about it is not helpful, though. There are other support groups that might be more of your style. And for people who need NA, I don't judge them one bit even if they go full holy roller on me. If it works for them and they are happy I'm happy for them. It's not worth arguing about. And yes, you have a point. Chain smoke cigs and get on a coffee drip, but drugs are bad mmk. Even though science shows that quitting nicotine GREATLY increases chances of staying sober. So many more examples. Edit: I myself can have a glass of wine on holidays, once or twice a year and I'm fine. I've met others like this. However, I think NA has a point and that for most people this is really, really dangerous. I've seen addicts ruin their lives by having a drink.

jdgzkp4,"Addiction is roughly 20% the substance you choose to use and roughly 80% the reason why you'd use whatever type of drug or substance. For instance: a person gets bullied ALL the time. He feels totally worthless and sad all the time and tells himself he has to think 10 times before saying or doing something because he's afraid whatever he'd do or say will cause people to bully him even more. (That is a crappy way to live your life) and at some point said person discovers cannabis. Whenever he used cannabis he felt like the king of the world and said and did everything that came to mind without feeling ashamed or whatever. From using once a month it goes to once a week to 6 times a day fast and said person realizes his whole career, social life and education gets destroyed in doing so he decides to seek help with his addiction and go to rehab. Said person never had a problem with alcohol so after two months he feels shitty again. He has been clean for those two months and decided to have a drink. Now he finds out alcohol does exactly the same and makes him feel like the king of the world to. This causes the same downwards spiral to happen all over again. This is why we at NA focus on zero tolerance, because most of us have zero tolerance. The beauty of NA is that we spread the message to the still suffering addicts among us that there is a way to quit using drugs and find a new and healthier way of life no matter what, because it works if you work it ❤️❤️❤️ Nowadays I go to an NA meeting almost every day and made tons of new friends that also want to find a new way of life and together we're finding that new way, but like I said using another substance that we've never had trouble with will result in the same old shit we've been recovering from. After all we didn't have a problem with our drug of choice before we used it for the first time. And using something else is just moving in to a new problem in stead of a solution. English is not my first language and I am tired as shit so my apologies if my answer is a little bit all over the place, but I do hope I've managed to explain it a little bit. Stay awesome ❤️❤️❤️",1679651933.0

jdgm8lk,"What you are experiencing is incredibly common among gay men who use meth. For most gay men, their meth use began as a way of making sex better. The two become so intertwined that it’s extremely difficult to separate them. There are actually researchers who have focused on the connection between the two among men who have sex with men. You might look into a book called Lust, Men, and Meth by David Fawcett. You may find some parallels that are useful. The important elements to reestablishing a healthy sexuality for you (whatever that looks like) that I’ve been able to determine so far, as a gay man in recovery, are these: 1. If you don’t have a sex drive right now, that’s fine. These things can take some time to come back and that’s a good thing. Most programs recommend a period of celibacy in any case, in part because it’s common for drug addicts to use sex addictively too. You’ll probably find your sex drive returning in due course. I’ve found including sleep, diet and physical fitness (especially strength training) in my recovery helps not just with mental health but also with restoration of the libido through increased testosterone production. 2. It’s incredibly easy to eroticise meth usage. This must be avoided at all costs. Do your best to keep your fantasy life focused on situations that don’t involve the drug. During a previous period of clean time, I got caught up in watching porn that involved explicit drug usage. I’d also masturbate to fantasies that involved me using. What I was doing was keeping those drug-using pathways in my brain in use and ready to go. Relapse soon followed. 3. In general, whatever your approach was to sex while you were using, you should take a completely different approach to it clean. In my case, that meant a lot of anonymous partners and one night stands. So in my recovery, I’ve focused on getting to know the individual first, slowing things down and adding a bit of romance to things. 4. Step work and therapy can be extremely helpful in figuring out what role sex plays in your addiction. For example, in my case, I’d use sex as a means of seeking validation from others. If you’re willing to jump into bed with me, then you must think I’m an OK person, right? It’s extremely difficult to break this habit. I’m incredibly frustrated spending time around other men in recovery who aren’t giving me that form of validation. But I recognize that I have to learn to be at peace with myself rather than seeking that external solution to an internal problem. Obviously there will be difference between how straight men and gay men approach these problems. But hopefully my experience can at least point you in a helpful direction.",1679640443.0
jdfftz8,"Are you getting the xanax via a doctor/prescription? It sounds like it will be easier for you to stop than you might think. Without judging, belittling or meaning to seem like I know it all, you might be just ""a little addicted"". What I mean is you're feeding more of a mental addiction rather than the physical one. It's all connected and absolutely blends into the same thing at some point. Like you definitely have the pre disposition for an addictive nature. You are definitely addicted to the relief that xanax is giving you. I'm thinking that you just might not entirely be ""chasing a high"" quite yet. Again, I say this not to minimize your situation but to give you some hope. Be safe but don't feed into the ""horror stories"" we read online or hear about. Benzo withdrawals can be very dangerous and you should absolutely talk to a doctor. Not even just because of the risks involved but because doing so will make getting off the xanax easier and increase your chances for success. A doctor can help with other non addictive meds both for your safety and to help with things like stress/anxiety going forward. You might be in a ""sweet spot"" where getting off a substance is actually easier than finding ways to cope with what it was helping with. It takes work but holy shit is it so much better than living chained up to an addictive substance. You don't want to live that way. It only gets worse. Having something in life that is slowly destroying you while being the only thing that seems like it helps is miserable. Take it from someone who gave up smoking weed everday for about 15 years and benzos for 3. Life is still tough sometimes but being able to even just explore better options is a million times better than having to rely on drugs that were slowly killing me.

jdecrz5,"Ok yes but times have changed they is usually say in AA/NA to “go back out & try controlled using/drinking” well if you tell somebody who’s an opioid addict in this horrible epidemic of fentanyl they’ll just go & die, I’ve lost friends because they got off of subs, & they relapse 1 time & they’re dead, I just think suboxone is a necessary evil, I’ve been on subs for 4 years straight with no opioid relapses, it can work & they have much better ways to come off of subs now, sublocade is a shot you can get once a month & after say 5 months & 5 shots, you can come off of subs with 0 withdrawals, I’ve seen a whole halfway house full of people who got off of subs through sublocade so I’m not just speaking out of my ass I watched them just stop with no issues, but that’s a whole other debate as subs are the worst to come off of, I think that the NA community I was in would disown me if they knew I took subs + a benzo for panic attacks, but I truly don’t understand why they aren’t more acceptable of people on subs, for gods sake people are dying left & right because of this epidemic… sorry for my rant I just had to speak about my experience & others I’ve seen die because they’re cravings came back hard when they get off, & if this was 10 years ago before fentynal i’d almost agree with telling people to go back out but it’s not the Roxy days & heroin is barely a thing anymore, just fent.

jddv9f6,"Dawg they said they been abusing up to 4mg a day for 3 weeks, I don't think OP is at risk of dying. I do still recommend not quitting cold turkey but risk of dying from this kinda use seems like exaggerating, it takes at least several months of daily heavy use for deadly withdrawals to appear for most people. &#x200B; But tapering is better, GABAergic withdrawals whether it's benzos, barbiturates, or alcohol, cause excitotoxicity, or AKA nerve cell death caused by overstimulation from your nervous system. Tapering helps avoid this adverse effect, cause even if you don't die from the withdrawals /seizures our nervous system will thank you. Edit: my bad I see you were replying to the person on 25mg a day for a month, yeah that kinda use does sound risky to quit cold turkey, I thought you were addressing OOP, my bad.

jddqeel,Would it be possible to start your own (or they start their own) meeting? I know when I found there wasn't a secular option I was able to start one at a meeting club that became fairly popular. Is it possible there is a larger need for an inclusive MAT meeting? AA and NA as a concept is fantastic in a lot of ways but there just always seems to be a lot of fear around folks who use Marijuana or suboxone or even prescribed medications to help their recovery. Some of it is due to relying on a flawed set of books as gospel. Some of it out of a 'thats not fair' kind of center. A lot of it just plain ignorance. But on thing that goes in its favor is it just takes 2 addicts/alcoholics talking to make a meeting.,1679593189.0

I agree that we all work hard to be in recovery. I believe 100% that Suboxone alone is not the answer. My problem arises with people who push MAT patients away from the fellowships of anonymous meetings. The idea of these meetings is to help whoever comes in the doors with their addiction/alcoholism. No matter how they’ve gotten clean thus far. It seems counterproductive and detrimental.

jdcta7g,"Hi. How are you doing today? I'm (45m) well today, writing from Ireland clean and sober for two weeks now. I'm a polyaddict and have been addicted to opiods, benzos, etc. I am a diagnosed alcoholic, ADHD and depression. My mental health had been rough for years over the loss of a friend's and love, but with lots of time spent in rehab and counselling sessions, I've learned more about myself and addiction, I also picked up a few tricks that I'm happy to share with you for your wellness and recovery. Writing this also helps me. 1. Don't please others whilst being hollow and broken. Dealing with your emotions makes you tougher in the long term. By really expressing and exploring your emotions by writing small prose, poetry, painting, or sketching, you turn the ugly onto something artistic and therefore beautiful. It's therapy for people like us. 2. You're not addicted to substances. You're addicted to the absence of feelings. Feelings that are felt in the body: grief, anger, despair, and worry, which you physically feel like in your stomach, chest, because of your thoughts. This is self-awareness. 3. Being mindful of the type of thoughts you have and labelling them as they arise will help you to objectively understand what is bringing you down. This is control. 4. Deal with the thoughts by talking to yourself about them. Cry, hug yourself, express them till they decrease. Then take stock of how you're feeling. Don't ignore the positive emotions and try to sustain them. This is taking action, but it becomes habit over time. You'll have noticed that I am not asking you to stop the drugs, drink or make any sacrifices. Just be aware and present in your feelings and thoughts to have better emotions. I hope you are well and can get better.",1679580386.0
jdbyimw,"DUDE, CONGRATS on the 21 days!! I’m also 26 and started at 18, soon as I hit college I was drinking like they were going to run out of alcohol. Lol Are you in AA/NA or any program? If that’s not your thing, that’s also alright. Those do definitely help with networking and making friends and adding something to your schedule though. What I like to do is do something (even if it’s/ESPECIALLY if it’s) small for yourself everyday. I remember when I was using/drinking I was basically surviving- who cares what I ate as long as I ate, just pulling into this park to smoke real quick, etc.. But instead NOW, treat yourself to some food you really like, go enjoy some random park/nature hike, take a scenic drive, cook, binge watch Netflix and have a lazy day. Enjoy the little things and take it a day at a time. And you’re not “adjusting to being a normal person”, you’ve always been a normal person-just had this craving for alcohol. I think you’re just changing your lifestyle now and realistically growing/maturing. I’ll admit too, it’s weird like that in early sobriety like getting back to living normally with the change of habits and life not being hectic 24/7. Take it a day at a time and make some friends/socialize. Speak up and let the world hear you Man. 21 days is huge and I’m proud of your growth, keep on going and keep asking questions when you don’t know what to do, you’ll continue to grow and be a better you.

I know how hard it is just to get there, and how low many of us can get before saying ""help"". It takes time to unlearn the things that kept us alive. And most of us in recovery used to survive, in one way or another. I HATED myself for so long for my use. But I realized that I was just trying to numb the pain, grief, and trauma. I don't have a ton of wisdom to offer right NOW because I'm still figuring out how to not be lonely myself, but I can tell you that the past 6 months of therapy and medication have saved my life. It's been hard, physically uncomfortable, and I still struggle most days to get to 0. But I've started to take myself off the island. I've learned to be more vulnerable - to open myself up to friends, relationships, family, the grief and trauma I avoided for decades. I'm still fucked up, have a ton of growth I need to do, but I finally have hope again. Trust the process. Stick with therapy even when you don't want to. Be as honest and vulnerable with the trusted people around as you can be, and give yourself some slack. And reach out to me if you want.

Far better to use this situation to teach your step-daughter how to cope emotionally and to teach her that we can’t run from tough situations AND to teach her that you and Dad will always be there for her no matter what.

I’ve been on so many meds for years now and I just want to get off all of them eventually as I feel like I’m on drugs, only without the high.. all the side effects weigh me down and numb me.

jd1jsqm,"For me, Rehab fucking sucked. I was an emotional mess.. 1,800 miles away from home, unfamiliar territory geographically, chemically, emotionally and mentally. The war stories around the picnic tables, the groups, the meetings, it all felt like some long ass dream. Not a nightmare necessarily, but one of those confusing dreams where almost nothing makes sense. Time just passed so slowly. Days just blurred into AM groups, lunch, Afternoon groups, a long boring break, primary group, dinner, meeting, sleep. Weekends were even worse as shit just slowed to a crawl. 48 hours of just sitting and pretending I was gonna be fine. There were no wire fences or guard towers, but stripped of my lifelong coping mechanism, I felt like a prisoner. I’ll tell you what I didn’t do… I didn’t ask if there were local sober alumni who might get me out for an activity for a couple hours, I didn’t try to make friends/contacts outside of treatment from whatever meetings they took us to to spend some time with sober folks outside of treatment. I was determined to suffer, and dammit, suffer I would. So, of course, about 48 hours after I completed “no further progress” I relapsed. I then spent the next 2 years finding new and interesting rock bottoms (still 1,800 miles from home) until I got the determination to maybe not suffer, to become an active participant in my own recovery (in March of 2010), and I haven’t looked back since. Rehab definitely helped me to realize I could go 90 days without a substance (for the first time since I was a teen) and it got me plugged in to a support network that was there when I was ready, albeit 2 years and a whole lot of suffering later. Get plugged in, inside and outside of your facility. See if you can get out of the treatment center on weekends or whatever with some approved people. Not only with a sponsor, to do step work… but just some folks who you can hang out with and catch a movie or play Call of Duty (if that’s a thing you do).

NA certainly does offer community, a community that understands you and accepts you and will bend over backwards to help you. Community isn’t what keeps us clean but it’s available to you through the program, sometimes that’s enough for people but usually an addict who finds themselves in a twelve step program benefits the most from working the twelve steps with a sponsor.

After my brother passed, I had incessant, obsessive thoughts about going back to drugs and drinking. A few things helped- 1) completely isolating myself from any substances (not allowing alcohol in the house, going to liquor stores etc.), not going to events with alcohol 2) remembering my brother who helped me through sobriety and wanted me to stay sober 3) seeing how much it impacted my dad, and not wanting to add to his pain. I held on to that for months and months. Now, I don’t have any obsessive relapse thoughts. The pain is still there, I think of him every day. But it does get easier.

jcxjau4,"Yes. It’s hard for a psychiatrist to make an accurate mental health assessment while people are still using, even a little bit really. They can assess substance use but so many symptoms overlap. So yes, if a person is maintaining sobriety and depressed they should probably talk to someone and get assessed. Ive taken medication in the past. Today I don’t feel like I really need it, I’m good but that’s me. I’ve also stayed sober 16 years and that surely helped my mental health lol. Regardless, I don’t think it really changes much about what I said. Nothing is perfect. In my case, anything, no matter how miserable, is less miserable than returning to use. Part of sobriety is learning. To manage discomfort. Because if comfort is my priority I’m sure to fail. It’s kinda what got me into my mess to begin with and it took me almost two decades to figure out maybe the drinking and drugs wasn’t helping lol. Sobriety has to me my priority over everything else, no shortcuts. But that’s me. It was hardcore at first but now it’s chill, drugs are a non issue in my life today.

jcxgfza,">Is it possible gor the addiction to rewire your brain so that you get nasty panic atavks unexpectedly every day? Of course. Putting aside that practically all drugs (but especially alcohol and cocaine) have that as their primary or comedown effect, every single dopaminergic drug can reinforce a pattern of thinking that says ""there is a threat to me"", and if you keep reinforcing that pattern of thinking eventually the threat will feel so large and immediate that you'll react as though your head is in a guillotine and have a panic attack. If you take a drug in response to the thought ""work is terrible and unbearable"", then the feeling that work is terrible and unbearable will grow. If that drug is say, alcohol, a drug that spikes your cortisol levels anyway, that effect will be multiplied. >How many months into rehab till i can expect stuff to be better. I found that after a single month of being clean, I was far from ""well"" but I was much better than I had been before I stopped. Remember, the drugs already have you in a state of absolute non-functioning. If you're having panic attacks every single day, you could not get psychologically worse - it would be all uphill. You also don't need an explicit rehab facility, but you are going to need help from a group - the most important thing in recovery is being surrounded by people who are all getting better because they're not using drugs. You need daily undeniable evidence that removing the drugs is helpful rather than harmful, to counteract the constantly re-forming belief that the drug helps.",1679302968.0
jcx6uci,It’s actually eerie how similar our situations are. My brother passed from a fent overdose last year. I got better and he didn’t. It sucks dude. We were best friends.

jcx4qbt,"I’m so sorry that you are dealing with so much tough stuff right now. I cannot assume to relate to what you are feeling, but in recovery for the last almost 6 years I have seen many people die and I always think about what I could have done. Ultimately, it breaks my heart, but the reality is that many, too many, people die in their addiction. If we are lucky, it spurs us to fight harder for recovery. But often, the guilt, shame, sadness and anger (among other emotions) are too overwhelming to endure sober. I don’t fault you for struggling. But I will tell you that those feelings can be managed with help and, if you are willing, professional support. We are logical creatures and often incapable of properly processing our emotions properly. Our addictive behaviors serve to attempt to help us temporarily soothe our discomfort, but it comes at a very very high price. I encourage you to get grief counseling to deal with the losses you’ve endured. And don’t give up on yourself. Your post shows desire to recover. And you most certainly can.",1679292706.0
jcwdiej,"I am not sure if/when you will see this but the disease model is so much more than you’re saying here. Please don’t summarize it as only applying to a tiny fraction of users that could literally die from withdrawals. That’s not accurate and lord is that a dangerous way of looking at this. Alcohol and benzos are the only two drugs that you can die from withdrawals from. The number of alcohols that have experienced seizures and severe withdrawal is not a tiny fraction. All of these drugs can and will kill you in use and we all know they often intermingle. I’m not sure why death=disease but I struggled with addiction being a disease for a long time and still do. However, all I really care about is that I know I drank against my will at times and alcoholism is progressive. I was sick, very sick, and rehab helped me medically detox three times. I’ve also detoxed at home with meds from a MD. So, however works but be safe and be safe if you or anyone reading is not ready to stop yet. I don’t think you have to tie the disease model of addiction into “big” rehab. That’s the end of my two cents.",1679276722.0

I still have Internet. I still have a cell phone with Internet service. I am not living in a homeless shelter. Only people who lose everything should go to rehab, or something like that."" But, I have also heard one other thing, over and over and over, ""I wish I had started recovery sooner. All those months and years I wasted. Why didn't anyone tell me that recovery was just a way out, just a way out for me to find the me that I always wanted to be, without all the confusion, and all the bullshit I gave myself all those years.""

jcvjp9l,"I would like to see that research, please. A majority of people I know in recovery (in the thousands) found it much harder to get off Methadone, Suboxone, and sublocade than heroin itself. Many of those people did not stay clean and continued to use drugs. And anyone taking naltrexone or getting vivitrol must be clean for a few weeks or else it will cause precipitated withdrawal. With that said, alcohol and benzo withdrawal can cause death and may require medication/ professional detoxing. My point is, I know more people who regret getting on MAT and staying on it for decades than people it helped long term. But it seems you may have only been reading research, and may not have much real life experience with people in recovery? I don't blame you, as I recently had a doctor not believe that I got clean without medication. She was shook. Overall, I'm not against MAT.

I know dozens of people who have been on vivitrol the shot, and naltrexone the pill ( they are the same medicine just in different forms.) Forgive me for laughing, but I didn't say I had no help 😂. I had TONS of help, just no medications. First inpatient treatment for 2 months, and then long term residential recovery living for 6 months. I just moved down to a less strict recovery house.

jcu6n4y,"No, I actually never said that people who don't want to drink can just stop. Those words are nowhere in my comment. With 8 months of solid sobriety, I know that I can only stay sober when the desire for sobriety is stronger than the desire for a drink. I needed inpatient treatment, first of all for court reasons but also to get me out of the environment that causes me to drink. I also learned how to have fun and get non drug induced euphoria. I laughed so hard in rehab that I was crying. Inpatient treatment also teaches you the dopamine pathways that cause euphoria are being massively overloaded when you consume alcohol or drugs. It's like hugging your husband may be a 50 on the dopamine scale, while drinking is a 200. Cocaine and meth are like 500. There is information that you can learn about the brain that helps you understand binge drinking and alcoholism. Insurance can and will pay for treatment if it's deemed medically necessary. And you can't afford it, but I bet if you stopped drinking every week you would save a lot of money. So what's more worth it? The alcohol or your life? Also, please do not go asking for NALOXONE. That is narcan, an opioid blocker for people overdosing on opioids. You are looking for NALTREXONE, which can reduce the cravings for, and effects of, alcohol and opioids. Extremely different drugs.

In 2020 I lost my brother to COVID, which I believe his own alcoholism didn’t help, and I spiraled. I finally reached out for help, and was put on naltrexone. I honestly didn’t want to drink anymore, and naltrexone was a magic switch that removed the debilitating cravings. I still had cravings, but I could manage them so much better. Even if I caved though, naltrexone would have been there to remove the affects.",1679242312.0
jcu4n2k,"Naltrexone is not a magic pill. You can and probably will drink on it, and the worst thing about it is you may drink even more to get the effects of alcohol. You claim to be an alcoholic, and that you can't stop on your own. Inpatient treatment could really benefit you. Naltrexone/ vivitrol are best used in combination with a recovery program and therapy. These meds may reduce cravings for alcohol, but they don't block its effects completely. I'm over 8 months sober without any medicinal assistance. I've learned every day there is no magic cure. The desire to stay sober MUST be stronger than the desire to drink. That's what keeps you on the right path.

jcu24kl,"Naltrexone really didn’t make much of a difference for me, and I was on it for at least 1.5 years. Gabapentin helped my anxiety, but similarly to the Naltrexone, did nothing for my cravings/urges. Vivitrol is wildly expensive in the US. I have “good” health insurance coverage, and the bill was still above $2,000 for one dose after insurance picked up some of it. I tried it for 3 months, and didn’t notice a change. I used Topiramate for a few years, and liked what it did for my cravings/urges, but my current psychiatrist doesn’t like patients taking it for a few reasons.

jctvsqq,"I think it is unreasonable to expect everyone to commit to complete sobriety. There should be more rehabs that will work with harm reduction plans. It is ridiculous in my opinion to offer Suboxone in rehab while treating kratom or weed as a harder drug. Most people are not going to die if they do not take Suboxone. I have too many negative side effects from kratom (irritability, indigestion, heightened unpleasant sensitivity to light and sound, mood swings) yet I still have taken it regularly for a decade. I have a difficult time moderating my weed use and was recently smoking nearly a quarter of top grade weed a week to the point where I could not even discern whether or not I was high, which has been extremely detrimental towards being able to save any money. So I am thinking total abstinence is best for me right now if weed and kratom not helping me, but I fully support that others may find them helpful or a better alternative to the opioids that are heavily marketed in most rehabs. I don't want to leave substituting kratom with a Suboxone dependency.",1679238504.0

jcq9qdo,"Drugs aren't addictive because they're fun - they're addictive because their dopaminergic action causes you to repeat a pattern of thinking that leads to their use. That means if you felt bit sad, and used drugs to cope, the dopaminergic action of the drug increased your tendency to feel sad - that's because dopamine's role is to create loops of behavior that lead to its release. Drugs, being the most potent releasors of dopamine in existence, create the strongest patterns of thought. In your case, way back when, you once felt a bit lonely and isolated, so you used drugs, whose primary (non-dopaminergic effect) distracted you, but whose secondary dopaminergic effect immediately increased your tendency to think the thoughts ""I'm lonely"" and ""I'm isolated"". Each time you had those thoughts you used, and each time your tendency to think that way was chemically reinforced by the drug, until you felt like that 100% of the time and therefore were compelled to use drugs 100% of the time. For as long as you continue to use, you will never be free of the feeling - the thing you believe is helping you is actually the cause of your loneliness, the feeling is only present and as strong as it is because you've constantly reinforced it by taking a dopaminergic drug.

While I’m open to groups / programs, I would also like to be able to change my behaviors on my own before going down that route. But joining a group is ""on your own"" - it's you utilizing a tool. By your own admission, you cannot currently think of another tool. You should look closely at yourself - getting over addiction is initially an exercise in doing what feels counter-intuitive, after all drugs corrupt your intuition. You've identified a common way people get help, yet come up with a bizarre excuse not to use it despite ""getting clean"" being your objective - whenever this is true, the safest assumption in the world is that the drugs have chemically corrupted your decision making process. At-least initially, you should defy such conclusions and do the opposite of what they're suggesting. After all, going to a group doesn't preclude you continuing to search for your own independent resources. I attended NA, but I wouldn't say the majority of the things that got me to one year sober were ideas that came from NA.

And walking wasn't bad. Then after the couple of weeks, I doubled my time. After a while, I really started enjoying the walking. All my aches and pains disappeared. And, yes. My energy went off the charts. I started staying up late. I stopped taking naps all the time. And, also, weird but true, my mood completely changed. And, at this time, I cleaned my diet up a bit more. Go talk to your doctor. We aren't doctors. There may be something unique for you, but most of us have this problem at first.

jci9wsx,"to be honest the route in which you take to get clean is not what helps you stay clean. you can do cold turkey, taper, 1 month to 10 years in rehab, it doesn’t matter. You can go through hell in a storm of fire and come out clean on the other end and still end up using. The ONLY thing that will keep you clean is making the decision not use, and not pick up NO MATTER WHAT. Now cold turkey can be something that is initially too difficult for someone to stick too and cause perpetual relapses. Tapering can also be difficult for some to stick to an honest and thought up regiment. It just depends on the person and what you think you’ll handle the best. Personally for me, I prefer cold turkey. If im going to quit and withdrawal anyways, just bring it on and lets get it over with. Also want to make sure though that whatever you’re going cold turkey from, isnt going to be psychologically and/or physically harmful depending on substance, amounts and durations.",1679013913.0

jceyc9z," Op, you’re not alone and you’re not high anymore or perpetually altered from this trip. You’re stuck in fight or flight and going to feel normal again. This exact situation happened to me from weed and sounds just like what you’re going through. When I was 17 I got way too high and had the scariest experience of my life. I thought for sure my weed was laced despite all my friends feeling normal and kept begging my friends grandma to call 911 bc I was certain I was dying. I felt perpetually stuck in a high for monthsssss I remember going to school feeling so terrified like I was stuck in a dream or watching my life as a movie all day long and coming home to watch YouTube videos of other people experiencing derealization and depersonalization (many with very similar stories to me who had these feelings brought on by bad highs as well) in the videos they would distort the camera lens to explain how it feels and it felt so comforting hearing and seeing that I wasn’t completely alone or crazy since no one in my real life had ever had anything like what I was experiencing. I dealt with this for many months and eventually it faded and life resumed as normal for me with the exception of a few sporadic panic attacks throughout the years that mimicked these symptoms. It’s been ten years since then now and 9 of those years have been 99% normal feeling, so it absolutely will get better. Recently I accidentally hit a delta blend pen because my friend said/thought it had no thc and didn’t get you high and had a total freak out panic attack at work and had to literally be driven home in my car mid shift. Since then, especially for the first 2-3 weeks I’ve been struggling with bouts of these feelings again, it’s not as much of the constant never ending derealization I had in highschool but random shorter bouts of it and onsets of feeling like I’m starting to get high again. It’s usually triggered by weird everyday things like going from one room to another with drastically different lighting and colors too much or too little stimulation. It fucking sucks and still scares tf out of me, but knowing I’ve been through it before and made it out and it’s just anxiety that will pass quicker the less I freak out over it helps make it a little more manageable than the first time. I’d recommend looking up on Reddit and YouTube stories of derealization and depersonalization triggered by drugs. Going through something relatively rare and unusual was terrifying but seeing others having gone through it too helped me a lot. I’d spend a day or two maybe looking through these stories to understand what you’re experiencing and then the best piece of advice I can give as difficult as it is is to ignore it as hard as you can. Stop spending conscience thoughts analyzing exactly how your body/mind is feeling. Ignore them when they come up and instead focus right back on the world around you, just think about what you’re doing right now and all the normal everyday things you used to spend your time thinking about before this trip to help immerse yourself back into reality. Distraction is by farrrrrr the best tool for these feelings and it’s going to be your key to getting out of them",1678963505.0

Wanting to continue hiding your past despite seeking recovery is very common. Since no one else is saying it, you’re trying to take an easy way out by using your mother working at the hospital as an excuse not to get help. Recovery and mental health are lifelong journeys, and as long as you have a loving family and salvageable relationships, not including them demonstrates the same exact addict behavior that got you into this mess. The goal is to get to a point where you aren’t practicing those behaviors at all. It goes deeper than you probably realize, and in the case of a true addict requires some medical or at least supervisory intervention to help you see the behaviors and thinking patterns, denial, etc. that are hiding and causing issues. As a starter, you’ve no doubt lied countless times in order to maintain and hide your addiction. You must begin with the opposite of that behavior, being honest.

The rest suck terribly, but won’t kill you in withdrawal.

If you can’t afford it, see your Dr & explain everything you’ve written to us about so clearly above. Your Dr can definitely help with your anxiety, do some blood work & suggest how you might go about tackling your problems in an organised way because you sound completely overwhelmed. Schedule regular follow up appointments. Fill your diary with them. Also go to AA in person or online. You don’t have to commit to anything with AA, just listen in ID / Speaker meetings & just let it all wash over you.

Unfortunately I understand the sleeping in class and driving part too well.

It was a 3 hour class with no break, and I got into a car accident on the way there one time as I was so exhausted… so yeah I went to another class, this one was closer and only 1 hr - free of charge and the teacher was nice. Then she quit not even 2 months after I was in her class.

jbrxdbq,"You sound like someone who is probably a bit older. I understand that you probably don't have any family members (children, nieces, nephews, etc.) who have ADHD but I think you should really educate yourself because, to be honest, this is a very bad look. Let me get this out of the way first: anyone that is talking about the Amphetamine shortage is someone who has been diagnosed with ADHD and has a prescription from a Doctor or Psychiatrist to take ADHD-medication. Yes, some ADHD medication has Amphetamines in it. Adderall is literally a mix of amphetamine salts. Therefore, the person that told you this, is almost certainly, getting their Adderall legally from a Doctor with a Prescription and I guarantee you that they have ADHD that they need to treat. Here is a Link in-case you need proof. _HYPERLINK_ Secondly; they told you about the Amphetamine shortage because they assumed you had heard about it and how it is effecting millions of Americans with ADHD and were intelligent enough to understand what that actually means because otherwise, why would they tell you about them looking for illegal drugs? Most people that look for illegal drugs won't reveal themselves like that. Addicts make mistakes with their bodies but by and large, they are very intelligent people. Finally, despite the fact that the person you work with is 100% a person just trying to treat their ADHD with legal medication, let's say you tattle on them to HR or get someone else ""official"" involved. What would that actually solve? The person is out of a job, does that help them get off of the ""illicit drug"" anymore than before? No, it makes it 10x worse. I understand that if you are technically the boss you need to protect yourself, but the only proof that you have is that they have ADHD and if you were to get them fired, he'd probably sue you for discrimination. As for staying up all night and not sleeping. Some people who take Adderall don't drink caffeine because they're both stimulants. If someone doesn't have their Adderall, they are probably going to substitute that with energy drinks or tons of coffee. I can tell you from experience that if you have no tolerance to caffeine or energy drinks and you are drinking a TON of them to stay awake/focus, you will stay up all night. I'm sorry that you come from a family of addicts but I would highly recommend finding some literature on addiction medicine or going to an AlAnon meeting (a meeting for friends and family members of addicts and alcoholics). I'd also recommend reading into ADHD. It is a clinically proven disorder that many people suffer. If you have it but aren't taking medication for it, it would be like living with terrible eye sight and no glasses. All of a sudden glasses (Medication) comes along and now you can function. Just something to think about.",1678514646.0
jbrr5ls,"The shortage is for Adderall to treat ADHD. Many rely on it to function and it is not an addiction if you have a dependence to a drug which you are taking as prescribed. I call my medication “amphetamines” because it saves time if the person doesn’t know what Vyvanse is. Especially if I am out of medication and am explaining my behaviour around it, because then the person instantly understands that I am in withdrawal and what that entails for me. People who are abusing amphetamines rarely call them amphetamines, they say things like Speed or Adderall (even if it’s not Adderall, cause they all feel the same really) and also there is no shortage on the illicit market. If this person was abusing the drug then they would simply switch to a different amphetamine since recreationally, most of them (except the MDxx compounds like MDMA which are their own separate thing) do basically the same thing. It’s only in medical settings where the differences matter so seeing as his wife is a psychiatrist, I see no reason why he wouldn’t have switched to Vyvanse or Dexedrine or something to continue getting his fix unless there is something about Adderall specifcally that helps him. I say stay out of it.",1678510674.0
jbrpspb,"I have experienced this too. People would always say something along the lines of ""You have to raise your bottom."" And I would always think: 'What a load of shit'. So one day my consequences started piling up faster than I could lower my standards, in that I couldn't deal with the consequences of getting fucked up anymore and continue living. Because I'm a narcissist coward, I decided to hold off on killing myself and went to rehab and happen to realize that if I wanted emotional sobriety, I would have to work a 12 step program. Shortly after rehab, I went in and out several times before I could realize that I had no control, no matter what. And eventually I surrendered to the fact that I needed help, because I couldn't do it alone. So everyday now, I try to keep that going. I DO things that remind me that I have to accept surrender to win. I don't know if it will relapse again in the future, but I have came to believe that the people of the 12 step program have an idea that works, not only for survival - but to happiness.

You have nothing to feel guilty for. Even if kratom is ""just"" a plant, it is still a drug, and it is still an addictive drug. Kratom addiction is not pathetic. You are not pathetic. You are human. Your body is simply doing exactly what it's expected to do in response to exogenous substances over time - physical dependency is NOT a moral failing. Addiction is NOT a moral failing.

jbef7v7,"This is interesting, I would definitely talk to the doctor who prescribed it about this. Klonopin is one of the longest-acting benzos on the market, its effects can last around 12 hours and the drug can stay in your system upwards of 72 hours. Longer half-life drugs tend to have a more rebound effects than shorter half-life drugs, but at this dose...after being on it for as long as you have? It's an unusual reaction, for sure. Were you my patient, I'd probably switch you to a shorter acting medication (if we haven't already tried those) like alprazolam or diazepam. I know you're not big on daily-dose medications, I might still at least suggest exploring a few well-tolerated non-benzo options that are good for managing anxiety/depression symptoms across the board. It sounds like you may have already been through the ringer with these though... I don't think you're having what I would call ""withdrawal"" symptoms in the sense that you're dependent on the medication. I think you may be sensitive to it and experiencing those rebound effects that some people experience when using this class of medications. It's not common, but when it happens, people who take benzos for anxiety/panic will experience heightened anxiety between the time the medication's effect wears off and the time the medication is eliminated from the body. It's usually seen at higher doses, though...it's sort of a ""benzo hangover"". Xanax and Valium are usually better in this regard, and if you're taking them intermittently, I'd think those would be better drugs for this purpose anyhow (again, assuming you haven't already ruled them out). As far as the munchies go...again, at higher doses, it's not uncommon for people to get junk food cravings but at clinical doses I usually hear people talk about how it removed their appetite entirely. My suspicion is that you're particularly sensitive to this drug. Most benzodiazepine medications are metabolized through the CYP3A4 enzyme...which is involved in metabolizing a lot of different drugs. People who are naturally over or under producers of that enzyme can have anomalous reactions to drugs. I personally am an overproducer, and as such most benzos have little to no effect on me at clinical doses...but other drugs affect me much more than they do others. For you, if you're under-producing that enzyme, then the drug is staying in your system longer and at higher concentrations. This could explain the rebound effects you're feeling, as well as the munchies. There are also some medications and foods that affect this enzyme (erythromycin, ritonavir, ketoconazole, nefazodone, cimetidine and grapefruit juice will all impact how you metabolize it...there are a few more in there, so make sure your doctor knows of any other prescription or OTC medications you're taking), if you're taking any of these, it could help explain this reaction. Anyhow, again, the best thing you can do is take this to your doctor and consider exploring other medications. I don't think a recovery subreddit is going to provide much more insight beyond this, because I really don't think this question has anything to do with substance abuse or recovery, but hey...we gotta start somewhere.

jb73gxu,"To me shaming yourself or viewing it as ""all down the drain"" won't help. You went through something really tough and you went back to the thing that usually gives you comfort. That is completely understandable. It's a choice that often comes with consequences, some of which can be fatal. It's always a crapshoot with fentanyl involved. If you don't see yourself stopping, please never use alone and always have narcan around and both you and they know how to administer it (a lot easier with the nose spray). If you want to stop but don't know how, there are professional treatment options including medication assistance. Medications can have drawbacks, but they can stop you from feeling sick. Some people will shame you relentlessly if you pursue medication. Apparently they'd rather an addict be dead than functioning until (if ever) they pursue ending medication assistance. I would prefer you live life as well as you can and support you in whatever decision you make. It's your life to live, not anyone else's. You didn't lose 6 months. I think continuous sobriety really isn't a useful metric \unless\ it's meaningful to you or one that's imposed externally by sober living or the courts. If you know one slip will always end in a full on relapse--I'm this way--then it's worth pursuing intense treatment.

I can barely remember anything from my childhood/ teenage years and my only memories are from my time spent in addiction, and increasingly as time goes on It gets worse n can only remember the bad shit that happened because it shaped who I am today, I felt so guilty because the relationship I was in she stuck with me from when I was smoking heroin in her parents bathroom and she thought I was just doing oxys still that I got prescribed and addicted to after coming out the army, to me getting clean and making it easier for me to get clean with the support and fun things we’d do. But towards the end I felt she was getting fed up of me things just changed and I was getting really unhappy even brought a bag and luckily threw it away in the end didn’t wanna risk going through the whole thing again and I knew it was putting my in that headspace so I decided it was best for myself to end it. It didn’t hit me for months I thought I was doing the right thing and tried to just move on mentally. It’s started to hit me more recently now and constantly remind myself that I threw it all away and that I’m basically grieving loosing my best friend I had even though I know it’d changed towards the end and was very distant and pissed eachother off a lot. Sorry for the essay Lmao but it really does help getting all this off my chest, breakups & addiction are a nightmare combination, I nearly killed myself a number of times after a previous girlfriend/ ex fiancée finished with me when I was 2 years into my heroin addiction, that just accelerated me massively to a rock bottom state and ended up in a psych ward a couple times.

jb4ouva,"So I was in a 4 year long relationship, we loved each other, and I was using heroin for 3 1/2 of those years, so maybe I can help shed some light on how he might be feeling. Frankly, you never know if someone who is struggling with addiction is ready to get clean or not; if he isn't ready to get clean, and he doesn't want to change, you likely won't be able to get him to. However, it's just as likely that he knows what he's doing is changing him and that it will likely destroy his life, and if he is ready to change and is just afraid to tell anyone close to him, your revealing that you know about his addiction could be very supportive. You need to prepare yourself for anything; he might lash out in anger, he might try to gaslight you and say he wasn't using drugs and that you imagined the whole thing, and he might break down and cry, or he might face it all with calmness because he knew the day would come eventually when he would get caught and have to give it up. Stay calm, and ask him some questions, like ""how long have you been struggling with this"" and ""do you think you can quit?"" and ""do you think some form of treatment could be helpful?"". From there all you can do is gauge his responses. Hopefully he's totally willing to open up to you and he wants to quit, but if he gets defensive and it turns into an argument, I would just drop it for the time, and bring it up at a later time when he's calmed down. If he does admit to using, the important thing is that he quits as a soon as possible, before the drugs warp who he is as a person. If he admits to using and says he'll quit that day, believe him and monitor his actions to see if he changes. If he admits to using but says that he can't stop or he'll be sick, then suggest he go to inpatient drug detox. If he keeps relapsing, suggest inpatient/outpatient treatment. As long as he's open and honest with you and he continues putting in honest effort, I would say that you're doing the right thing. If he denies it outright, or if he gets clean for a period and then you think he has relapsed but he won't admit to anything, the thing to do is to just drop it because you'll never get an addict to admit what they've been doing if they aren't ready, and just order some urinalysis tests online without telling him about it, and hit him with one out of the blue one day. If he won't take the test you can be sure that he's using. If he takes the test and it's positive, see above. If, however, he refuses to admit a problem, refuses to get help, refuses to talk about it, and just shuts down all of your attempts at helping him, you have to seriously consider leaving him, at least temporarily, until he changes and becomes open to getting the help he needs. If you have any more questions, feel free to message me. I'm 29 and I've had 6 years clean before, relapsed for a few years, and now I've got about 8 months clean again, and I was just in this situation with my ex, but on the other side of it, so I'm sure I could give you helpful advice for whatever situations might come up.",1678105568.0

Sobriety only works if you’re cutting out all drugs/alcohol as I believe. One thing can so easily lead to another.

For me (main problem was drugs) I cannot use any drugs or alcohol it ends up leading me to the same place. I have also found the only way I’ve stayed sober for long periods of time has been some sort of community either aa or church or whatever and also actively trying to change myself. So that looks like replacing drugs/ drinking with other habits like exercise, getting in nature etc. hanging with like minded people, not going to bars. Trying to better myself. I’ve never been successful at just not drinking or drugging for a long period without change and healthy substitutes. When I started it was suggested 90 meetings in 90 days.

jb28usp,"Firstly, thank you for sharing your experiences here. Personally trying to keep my sobriety up from alcohol, the only way I've managed to get this far (17 days) is by going back to nicotine which I managed to quit for over a year. I was going through essentially 3 pack's worth of nicotine a day, and it took me over 20 tries to quit. So of course, when I told myself ""nicotine won't be as bad as drinking, if you can stay sober then it's okay"" and I took that first puff, I felt insanely discouraged. Enough so that I kinda freaked out the next day and almost checked myself in somewhere. I got past it, but goddamn that was a rough step. Regardless, I think something about the ""harm reduction"" behind it seems to have helped, but I'm trying really hard to understand my underlying addictive behaviors. I never knew how deeply rooted they were (food, sex, alcohol, self-harm, etc.) so it's been quite the rollercoaster as far as self awareness goes. That being said, I feel comforted knowing I'm not the only one who feels a bit defeated in this addictive aspect, despite the ""method"" being less harmful than the alternatives. True and ""complete"" sobriety is a surprisingly tricky thing to achieve. Maybe one of the key insights here is that despite practicing some harm reduction, the underlying principles behind our behaviors are the same, and therefore still self-defeating. So no wonder it feels so frustrating, as well as disempowering. Something that I've noticed that's helped me recently is recognizing that, despite my brain always searching for higher highs, I can (at least to some extent) choose highs that aren't as harmful as others. As an example, going to the local rec center and just dousing myself in the steam rooms or sauna. The physical effects help a ton with my stress levels, and because the stimulation is so intense it seems to satiate some of those addictive urges. Either that, or I end up reverting back to the nicotine I fought so damn hard to stay away from lol. My brain is just begging to feel something. Something. Really, just anything. Anything intense or novel. Something about feeling ""normal"" is revolting in its own strange way. Anywho, it's nice to see someone who shares some of the same problems. Just remember that even when it feels incredibly disheartening, if the decision you make means less harm for yourself in the future, then it's not necessarily a bad one. Harm reduction is better than going all out and effectively just fucking your life up. Be proud of yourself for getting away from the hard stuff. You've gotten this far, and you have purpose behind why, so don't give up because you hit a pot hole when you could've crashed and totaled your car instead. As far as preventative measures go, I think that's something that I'll have to figure out too. I've made myself a sort of safety plan that helps me kinda navigate away from ""crashing."" Recognizing your warning signs, using coping strategies, and identifying critical, genuine reasons behind why you should follow through. Not just base level ""because I want to be sober"" but really dig for those reasons. Why do you want to be sober? For your family, or your health, or sanity? How do those things help you feel fulfilled? What things do you truly believe to be good, and how can you help those things grow? How does your sobriety fit into it? Last thing- something that has helped me a ton is recognizing that I shouldn't just do things because I want to, but because I have to. That's vague enough that I can't really articulate it, but once you recognize those things that you see as truly good, you can more easily follow through and help integrate them into your life- piece by piece. Again, thank you for sharing. I appreciate your words and I wish you the best of luck, friend.",1678052877.0

AA isn’t the only way to get sober. There are many other support programs available. If they’re not available in your area, why not start one? Religious beliefs have no place in AA. I say this as a Christian. Some people even use the groups themselves as their higher power. Basically anything that isn’t you, or another single human being, can be a higher power. I don’t talk about Christianity in meetings. Sometimes I talk about it with other Christians when we’re in the parking lot. But that’s not in the meeting. As others have said, AA is full of sick people. So is the rest of the world. Some people in AA want to get better. Some don’t. I don’t associate with those that don’t want to get better.

jb06xbu,"A porn addiction, in a lot of ways, is a lot harder to treat than a drug addiction, if you ask me. It's a lot more deeply ingrained to a person's psyche, as sex is one of the deepest parts of our ego. But there's always the issue of, what makes it an addiction? In my experience, the majority of people I've met who claim they have a porn ""addiction"" are either Christians who have a massive guilt complex about it, or they're meth heads who use the drug and watch porn for 12 hours straight. If his issue is the former and he just has a guilt complex about watching porn, I would say it's actually a non-issue, to be frank. I mean obviously I can't talk someone into having different morals than my own, but when I've been in a relationship with women who watch porn, it's never bothered me. If his issue is the ladder, however, watching porn all day on his days off, or letting int interfere with his responsibilities, then it is an actual addiction. The definition of an addiction is a compulsive activity that is continued despite the negative consequences it has on one's life. With a ""porn addiction"" there are no consequences outside of what it does to a person's conscious, psyche, and their time. If your boyfriend has a serious porn problem, that is effecting his ability to function in his life, I would say you need to get serious about him shaping up, or get ready to leave him. If he's just a guy with a guilt complex about his sexuality, however, I would try and be there for him and help him heal that part of himself.",1678020081.0
jazwc7p,"So I have pretty traumatic experiences as well that most people haven't experienced. I go to a psychologist, and take meds with a psychiatrist to deal with those issues. I have had to learn the hard way, that there are toxic people all over the world in and out of AA. My experience is that AA is not the best place to express the deep personal trauma I have, with any and everyone. Much like I wouldn't go to my boss and coworkers at work, and explain to them my trauma even though we have figured out a solution to making money for our own survival in society. It's not professional. Recovery is the same way for me. I had to see it as spiritual progress instead of religious, in that spirituality affords me an individual experience of things that are greater than me that I have no control over. For me, that's why I attend meetings. It's inconvenient, it makes me upset and uncomfortable, and it allows me to practice my interactions and listening skills with people even though I don't want to have them. And I'd like to think that I am not the only one in the room that feels that way when I attend. Most of the time I just say ""Hello"" and ""How are you?"" and then listen. And most of the time when they are done talking I just say ""Oh. Okay."" and smile and try to do something helpful. I make coffee and clean a lot at the groups I attend. It's the easiest way to help out, and the perfect exit strategy from conversation. I would say, don't drink. And that's a lot easier said than done. I think the fact that you are able to identify and understand your feelings towards AA is progress that you may have not had before. You seem to understand yourself and know what's working for you and what's not. And that's commendable because there are many who can't or won't. I don't know if any of this helped, but I wanted throw in my $0.02 in the basket for you. I hope things turn around for you, because you seem to really want sobriety. Cheers.",1678011542.0
jaz8b2r,"Hey friend. I used to go through these cycles of building my life up, buckling under the pressure, getting really fucked up for a while until I couldn't deal with life anymore, and then fall into a massive depression. Rinse and repeat. I got sober last October. For months up until that point, I had been spending all day and night in bed, never leaving my house. I ended up stumbling upon AA meetings on Zoom and started attending them from my bed on my laptop. I gave it everything I had, which was only hope and a will to live. I encourage you to try to do the same. For me, it was only about a week before I had graduated from my bed to the couch, where at least I had begun sitting upright to attend the meetings. About a week after that, I had managed to clean off a desk space and start doing my meetings from a chair at a desk. From there, I began going to them while walking outside or driving around in my car. Today, I'm working full time and attend them from wherever a few times a week. They truly were what I personally needed to get my life back. I needed human contact and a list of guidelines to live by to help pull me out of the literal dark I was trapped in. It worked.

jaz3x5u,"It's not often I see anyone talking about a gaming addiction. This doesnt mean it's any less of an actual issue though. It's great you are reaching out for some advice/help. To start, abstaining from playing video games in general is going to be your best move. I'm not saying forever but at least for the foreseeable future. ""Moderation"" works for some people with any addiction but not that often. It sounds like you went pretty hardcore with yours as well. Putting down the video games for awhile will give you the opportunity for change. Primarily a ""change in perspective"". You want to give yourself the chance to realize life will go on without video games. It might not be ""amazing"". Hell, it might even kinda suck. Despite this you need to give yourself a chance to reset and see life a different way. Video games can be a source of huge ""dopamine dumps"" and a platform for an ""escapism mentality"". Trying to moderate things (video games in your case) that offer an easy way out will likely just be a roadblock to making real progress. The real progress will take some work. It's not necessarily going to be easy but it will get so much better. Every aspect of your life will improve. Once you take away the video games and life goes on you have the chance to look at why they do what they do for you. Are you escaping from reality? Why? Is nothing else in your life offering any pleasure? Why? These are just two very broad examples. Addictions are usually more of a solution to problems rather then the ""root problems"" themselves. This is why ""moderating"" usually doesn't work out. Get into therapy. I can't stress this enough. A professional will really help you figure out what is going on. Another ""quick"" solution is to start exercising regularly. Exercising offers a release of dopamine and endorphins but in an arguably healthier way. I mean exercise is good lol. It's also something we can't do for hours and hours. So the dopamine and endorphins are limited. It's a good way to ""come down"" off the continuous highs our addictions offered. So get into the gym for awhile each day or just go jogging/walking. Just getting out into nature can help as well. You are going to have to do a lot of things you dont want to for awhile. Its commonly referred to as ""getting comfortable with being uncomfortable."" Try to keep in mind that being in uncomfortable situations offer some of the best opportunities for positive change and growth. That the current feelings of being uncomfortable, discontent, unhappy, etc aren't facts. They will change and if you stick with it, things will get better! Message me anytime!",1677990845.0

jaybqbi,"I had a similar experience. I just wanted to be heard and it felt like people were offering a solution without understanding what MY unique problem was, so it couldn’t possibly be a solution for my issues. A lot of us have been through some fucked up shit and I personally wanted to scream at a cruel world that let that happen, if not burn it all down and start over. For me, I felt like I needed to have something to say no to for once in my life and do things on my own terms for a change rather than the world’s. I wanted to be seen and accepted and feel safe first. I was already so ashamed of where things had gotten and it felt like people were telling me I was the problem, which made it feel even worse. I already felt like I was the problem and for me it took so long for me to get to any place of self acceptance and liking some of my quirks or coping mechanisms that it felt like pointing the finger back at me as the source of all my problems was just like the religious bigots pointing at me as being the problem. A huge issue for me is shame and religious trauma. I have had to secularize the steps entirely for them to even remotely make sense to me. There’s a book that does a good job at that called “staying sober without god” by Jeffrey munn and I think it’s been really helpful for me when I was ready to actually look at myself and what I was doing. I think I sense tremendous pain and frustration in what you’re writing. For me working on myself doesn’t mean approving of the fucked up things that have happened. It does mean acknowledging and understanding that fucked up things have happened and while everyone deserves to grow up in safety and without horrible experiences, a lot of us don’t get that luxury, and we have to learn how to handle life moving forward in a way that doesn’t make things even worse. I wanted vengeance, I wanted someone to validate what I’d been through, and to just have something that would take the pain away as quickly and effectively as the drugs did but with fewer adverse consequences. It’s a fool’s errand—their comeuppance will likely never come, people validating me will only last for so long before I need more, and there is nothing out there that will numb my pain quite as effectively as drugs. But for me it’s using aspirin to treat a bacterial infection—it may not hurt for a bit but the pain will worsen because the infection isn’t getting addressed. There are effective ways to deal with shame and trauma that will feel really unpleasant—trauma informed treatment is usually done through exposure while shame based trauma is sometimes treated through mastery and learning self-validation. That’s what’s helped for me. I know how obnoxious AA people can be. Please just know that there are good people in the rooms and outside of them. Every group of people will have those who try our patience. Those people don’t speak for the entirety of AA or whatever support you pursue. Meetings really aren’t effective, nor are they meant to be in AA—it’s the steps that deliver recovery. There are a lot of different fellowships out there and professional as well as peer supports. You get to decide how you approach it. For me I had to keep asserting myself and trying things my way and falling on my face until I was ready to accept that my way of living doesn’t work for me and I needed to try something else. If I don’t try anything new, I’m bound to wind up using again. The principle that undergirds the first step is acceptance. For me it was helpful to look at that as the final stage of grief. I had to go through all the other four stages first before I could get to a place where I was willing to try something else.",1677976344.0
jayaymu,"CW: Abuse I left Christianity. I left it because it hurt more than it helped. I left it after realizing that yet again, I am caught in what is now the fourth generational cycle of religion-based trauma (except I wasn't deported to give birth, forced to stay there, and forced to see my child as a sibling, forced to move across the country and give my child up for adoption, and so traumatized by a personal experience that I made the people in my life and home a prisoner of Lent), and I said ""this ends here"". I left it because of the pure vitriolic hatred it now espouses against anyone non-cishet male and white. >Another thing AA doesn't deal particularly well with is childhood trauma, PTSD and other mental illnesses. No, it doesn't. Or developmental/neurological illnesses, of which autism is one. Trying to explain my experiences in recovery/sobriety through the lens of an autistic person got me called ""a victim"", told I ""was making excuses"". I spent one meeting in full flashback mode. I wondered when he was going to hit me. Because that's what people did to me if they thought I was making excuses, being defiant, existing. I don't think AA had the knowledge about those things then, which...yeah, none of those items were things that were talked about, or even really known. But one would think that they would embrace the science, but instead they just entrench themselves in a boatload of bad decisions while telling the world that they are the best - the Wilhelm II of recovery models. >The ""answer"" to that is usually the trifecta of ""pray about it,"" ""read the Big Book"" and ""work the Steps,"" which has little to do with trauma issues.

Everything was just overruled with a paint roller when when maybe...a paintbrush would have worked. >I now go to one AA meeting a week that is quite good and graceful. I'm glad you can do that. I'm glad that they help you, and that you are able to take what you need for your life and leave the rest. I am not able to do that, even with DBT. I walk in there, no expectations, and often come out sad or triggered. I don't have the experiences that you do, and that's okay. The beauty of recovery is in it's diversity; same with humanity. But I can never endorse it. Or go back there.",1677975979.0
jay02mc,"I'm in DBT. For the first time in 57 years I feel like I am getting real help through it. But you have to work at it, and it's hard work.

jaxxt2t,"I am a bit different in that I am a Christian by choice. I came out of a hardcore fundamentalist Mennonite environment, where you were shit, liking yourself was the sin of pride, JOY was ""Jesus First, Yourself Last, Others In Between,"" and ""God sends little boys who don't want to go to church to go live with the Devil."" I found my way, by the grace of God, to a much more graceful way, and it was not through AA. I had to find my own path. It sounds to me like you are feeling your way to finding your own path, and kudos to you for it. Another thing AA doesn't deal particularly well with is childhood trauma, PTSD and other mental illnesses. The ""answer"" to that is usually the trifecta of ""pray about it,"" ""read the Big Book"" and ""work the Steps,"" which has little to do with trauma issues. As I get deeper into DBT, which empowers one to seek grey areas, think your way through difficult issues, and middle ground, the further I move from AA, which is ""your best thinking got you here."" I now go to one AA meeting a week that is quite good and graceful. To me the Big Book is an early 20th Century work of literature, written by men who took a religious (yes, religious) tradition from England (the Oxford Group) and synthesised it into a path that has helped many live soberly - but not everyone. AA itself makes no claims to being the ""only"" way, though many AA's do make that claim. Some AA's claim the first 164 pages and page 412 of the Big Book to have every solution for every problem in life, and it just doesn't, nor does it make that claim for itself. In conclusion, I have become one who truly does ""take what makes sense for my life and leave the rest."" Some do not like that, but it works for me.",1677969939.0

Sadly, I know waaaay more dead people than I'd like but that's the reality of addiction. Many die.

If you put 100% into every relationship, you will soon find out who is willing to reciprocate that effort and who is not.

jamyld5,"20 + years, i chose not to celebrate for a few years now and YES! i am questioning everything as well. What i have found is that there is a lot of good stuff in AA and it is geared a lot towards the newcomer. Also people continually throw ""wisdom"" from the book around like it is a blanket answer for every single problem we might have when it really isn't. I needed to stop taking everything those people said at 100% and start using my own brain and questioning things. Once i started it felt like i was betraying everything i had learned in AA and once you start questioning you might as well be on your way to picking up a drink ,we hear this shit often in meetings and i was brainwashed unfortunately. It is GOOD to question sponsors, speakers, the big book, the literature, it is good and necessary. I have also found that once i attained a level of honesty and awareness and some spiritual tools from AA that i could take those things i learned and use them elsewhere. i feel AA does NOT hold all my answers and that by listening to those that claim it did i was causing myself suffering. I have read the big book so many times now I have trouble hearing anything new, at this point in a logical person's life they would start to look elsewhere. AA does NOT hold a monopoly on intelligent progress in my life. I started looking at ""self-help"" books, or maybe to be clearer, ""religion and spirituality"" section of the store and i found i do have to sort through a lot of unhelpful books, but i have found a few that really speak to me and tell me things the big book does not. A lot of times it does not conflict with what i have learned in Aa, it adds to it. again, i was using the tools in AA as blanket solutions for every situation and i think for me, the answers are to keep searching, keep learning, keep expanding my vocabulary and to see that I HAVE worth, I was told in AA so much that i didn't matter, that my ideas were stupid and selfish and that god had a much better plan for my life than i did and i needed to let go and follow that plan. I tried to do this, in fact i let go so much that i didn't move forward while i was waiting for the plan to be indicated to me. I now see AA's excessive stressing of belittling myself as detrimental to people like me. I am now convinced that god wants me to be an active participant in my life and that i need to do the greatest portion of the work with god offering a little helping hand now and then. this goes directly against some of the stuff in the big book and many of our most popular speakers but i feel ok with that now. they do what works with them and i have to do what works with me.

jalq2dv,"I hear you. 12 step recovery is great for getting clean and sober, and learning how to live a clean and sober life, and it gave me a community so I didn't have to do it alone. I tried to get clean alone for years and failed, I'm 23 years this year, and there is no way I'd be here without NA and AA. At 10-15 years, though, I really struggled. I went through great personal loss and grief, and my persistent mental health stuff wasn't going away. People kept telling me that if I didn't feel good, I just needed to double-down on steps and sponsorship. I did work the steps again, but I didn't feel like I could sponsor people; as i didn't have the 'life beyond my wildest dreams' I felt like a fraud who couldnt help anyone else. I got more and more alienated from meetings and the 12 step message; I felt like a failure, but also intuitively knew that there was something missing for me. I did eventually go on anti depressants (that's another story, for me it's a short term solution that leads to more long term problems, but given the state I was in it was probably the best thing; even though it took five years to get off them), and I began a journey of therapy. Seeing a therapist helped me a lot, but not until I'd read a lot of books and studied therapy to have knowledge of the theories and mechanisms; I needed to understand it to understand what helps and what doesn't. The first therapist I had was pretty much a waste of money. These days, I understand there's no single magic bullet for mental health; not 12 steps, not meditation, not medication, or therapy. All of these things are tools, not cures. The recovery community and my recovery friends are central to my life; I want to stay clean and sober, no question, and I need my community around me to do that, but I mostly go to ACoA meetings now. I focus on my emotional recovery, It's gentle, safe, incredibly supportive and gives me a whole range of practical solutions beyond 'work the steps and get a sponsor'. Recovery isn't simple. Many addicts and alcoholics have deep-seated mental health issues; sometimes, believing in God and doing an inventory isn't enough. It's OK to question 12 step recovery, it''s OK to seek other avenues of help.

jaispue,"So the first thing is, you need to have a realistic plan of attack and an idea of what you're dealing with. It sounds like your husband is a good guy, and if this is just coming up now, he likely doesn't have the disease of addiction... YET. Let me explain: The disease of addiction is a chemical imbalance in the brain that is caused or worsened by drug abuse; it is a semi-permanent condition that makes a person suffering from it unable to have a healthy relationship with any mind altering substance. Most people with the disease of addiction will struggle with it the rest of their lives, and will never be able to do simple things like go out and have drinks with friends or even be around alcohol in some cases, and many of them will need counseling and/or support groups for the majority of their life. Think of the disease of addiction as a big line in the sand: as a person keeps abusing drugs, they get closer and closer to crossing the line; if they catch themselves and stop, they back away from the line... but if a person doesn't catch it soon enough, and they go over the line, most people will never be able to cross back over the line, and they will never be able to drink normally or be around alcohol/drugs again without risking a relapse, and things only keep getting worse if they keep on using after they cross the line. Obviously it is in your husbands best interest that you two interrupt the progression of this illness as soon as possible. Luckily, there is a tried a true method of arresting this process, it is repeatable, and has an extremely high success rate, so long as you follow it to a tee. 1. Your husband is gonna' have to take some time off of work, medical leave, and basically drop all his responsibilities for a few weeks. It is a medical condition so it's legally required of employers to allow him the time off in most states. 2. He's going to have to schedule an appointment with an Inpatient Detox facility. THis will usually last 7-14 days. 3. From detox, he should be shuttled directly to an inpatient treatment facility. Most facilities offer 28, 45, and 90 day programs. In your husbands case, 28 days would likely be his recommendation from the counselor at the facility, but he won't know until he goes. 4. After completing Inpatient Treatment, he should be set up with a clinic near your home. Once he comes back home, he will have Intensive Outpatient Treatment anywhere from 1-3 days a week, usually for 90 minutes if 3 days a week, to 120 minutes if once a week. They are flexible and are usually open late to accommodate people's work schedules. IOP will usually last 6 months at 3 days a week, followed by Outpatient Treatment which is 6 months at once a week, followed by After care for 3-6 months, which is just a once a month meeting with his counselor from IOP/OP 5. His clinic will order him to go to 3 Narcotics Anonymous/Cocaine Anonymous/Alcoholic Anonymous meetings a week, of his choosing. Meetings generally last 60-90 minutes and are a format to speak with other people who are dealing with early recovery, and they also function as a place to meet people who have been clean for 10, 20, and 30+ years clean, so they can share their guidance. These self help meetings are also a place to meet people and form new healthy relationships for people who struggle with that. It will likely be required he go to these self help meetings for the 12-18 months that he does his IOP/OP/After Care, but the majority of people find the meetings to be very helpful and enjoyable, and many of them decide to keep attending meetings at some level afterwards if they feel they need it, while some just go back to their regular lives and only return if they relapse or are struggling. As his wife, it is your place to support him, but also to not be co-dependent and enable him to continue abusing drugs and destroying his mind. The steps I layed out at the standard procedure for the treatment of addiction, and if followed, they do work. Print out what I wrote down, tell him about it, and be firm that he needs to get help. You'll get the ball rolling by googling local Inpatient Detox facilities near you, calling them, and asking when the soonest they can get him in is, and you'll need to ask them if they can schedule his inpatient treatment or if you'll have to arrange that. If you do need to arrange it, Detox facilities normally have a list of Treatment facilities that accept most insurance, and if they don't I would call your insurance and ask them for help on the matter. :) |I've been doing counseling/treatment since I was 20, I'm 29 now, and I have been involved in this stuff for almost a decade. Trust me, everything I said is exactly how courts handle it, how treatment facilities handle it, it's all standard operating procedure. I know it sounds like a lot, but it will literally save your husbands life, and your marriage. Think of it as one year of his time for the rest of his life for you two to be happy together.",1677697704.0
jai8oa9,"For me personally, the only thing that helped me stop was when everyone I loved finally had enough. That crippling loneliness is what pushed me to my bottom. My dad is an alcoholic as well. He had to sober up for a hospital procedure, and when he went back to drinking after that, it got really bad. My family paid for his rehab, then he was put on a scholarship and now lives at a sober living facility in California. He’s been sober for a few months, but his drinking drove my mom to insanity. She won’t find the time to go to get help. I love both of them dearly, but his drinking and my moms insanity really made a mark on me and my sisters. The best advice I have for you is to go to Alanon meetings. You can’t make him get sober, you can only focus on yourself. I have experiences on both sides. For me personally, when I had no one to enable me, I finally became miserable enough to hit bottom. In Alanon you learn how to not enable. Watching my mom suffer has been heartbreaking. I don’t think anyone deserves to go through what she has gone through. But the best option is to seek help for yourself.",1677690138.0
jai2sip,"I’ll have 2 years this May. I went to rehab at the age of 30 and spent most of 31 living with my mom while I went to AA meetings and focused on sobriety. The first 6 months were tough, I hated that I lived with family, was single, broke, and felt broken. By focusing on sobriety, I got my life back. I saw others in AA that were financially successful, had families, and good lives and they were no smarter than me, just sober and focused. So I did what they told me to do and put sobriety first. While living with my mom I started a company, shortly after I moved out to another state, and 9 months later met a great person who I want to marry. I now have a successful business making multiple 6 figures, a great partner who loves me, adopted two cats, and I’m moving into a nice 2 bedroom apartment next month to upgrade from my 1 bedroom. Life can get better really fast. For me, it took one year of absolute focus on sobriety to get back on track. Now I go to 3-5 AA meetings a week, pray and meditate daily, work with a sponsor, and sponsor others. These things keep me sober and focused on helping others.",1677687886.0

jahm5wu,"Hi I don’t know if this is any help but I am an addict in recovery.(4 years+) I found rehab very useful. Initially just as your husband suggested, I thought at least I won’t be able to use. But actually while I was in residential rehab (9 months) It was more about the things I learned about myself and how to cope with life on life’s terms that has made it possible for me to stay away from mind altering substances. He has admitted he has a problem (this is very encouraging) so really the next step is getting help to get away from the availability of substances (so he has a chance to recover) I certainly recommend rehab. It cost me nothing at all. There are many rehabilitation centres that offer a free service (UK) They are sometimes faith based such as Christian rehabs but not only. I’m not sure where in the world you are but it’s worth looking into. The rehab I went to was Christian but you needed be a Christian to sign up. In fact there where Buddhist and Muslim people there whilst I was there. I also lived in a NA 12 step housing organisation after rehab which again was free. I only had to attend a weekly meeting with a support worker. I attended face to face NA meetings and after around a month got myself a sponsor. After I had been in recovery for a year I volunteered at the Christian rehab as well as being part of the NA group service committee. I was a hopeless addict who had been abusing substances for over 20 years. I guess what I’m trying to say is there is hope. I am now back with my wife and daughter and have no desire to use mind altering substances. My biggest hurdle was admitting I had a problem. I hope your husband appreciates the support you are giving him and I wish your both all the best. Keep moving forward a day at a time.🕊️",1677681201.0
jahkoy1,"Thank you so much! He does have a serve case of major depressive disorder. I’ve talked to him about it multiple times, and told him that he really needs to go to therapy. He always tells me when I bring up therapy that he knows everything that a therapist is going to tell him, and that he has a bachelor’s in psychology. I’ve told him that I’m a child and developmental psychology major, but I still go to therapy 1-2 times a week and have a mentor that I meet with weekly who’s a licensed therapist. I’ve also told him that even though I know what my therapist, psychiatrist, and mentor are doing to tell me that it helps me to hear it from someone else. He just always brushes it off and continues to stew in his depression. He doesn’t have a job, hasn’t had a job since he got out of the 28 day intensive program, doesn’t go to any meetings, and just goes to the center 3 days a week to drive for them and if they send him home on his driving days he ends up laying in bed playing video games or sleeps. I’m really worried about him because I love all the guys in the house and want to see them improve and thrive. I’ve just always seen from him that he’ll improve for a little bit and then go back to his old behaviors. It’s really frustrating and I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m going to talk to my house manager today and also talk to staff about it because, he needs some help and I feel at this point that he needs to be put on a 30 day contract and told that if he doesn’t get help that he’ll be exited due to his mental health affecting the guys that he lives with.",1677680555.0

jaftqwm,"He can't stay in rehab for the rest of his life. Drugs aren't going anywhere, so at some point in time, it comes down to him building the foundation and support networks he needs to stay in active recovery. When looking for counselors, try and make sure they specialize in addiction treatment. Addiction treatment has evolved pretty rapidly over the last decade, and a lot of improvements have been made. You'll want counselors that understand what evidence based, outcome oriented treatment is. I'm not 100 percent sure about coke, but there might be medication assisted treatment (MAT) available to help mitigate the post acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS) that he's experiencing. Typically that's whats going on if a person goes through acute withdrawal, but relapses a short time after. There might be medication that helps stabilize his mood, and help with cravings. The idea of hitting ""rock bottom"" before being ready to get help is a dated and dangerous one. Some people's ""rock bottom"" is below the level that a human can survive. Addiction is a chronic illness, saying a person needs to hit rock bottom before getting help is like saying someone needs to have a heart attack before they are treated for hypertension or high blood pressure. Lastly, not sure where you are located, but Fentanyl is making it into lots of street drugs in the US. Not just heroin and other opioids. Its turning up in amphetamines and cocaine as well. So every time he goes to score, he's not only gambling with a run in with law enforcement, but the potential to overdose on Fentanyl that makes it into whatever batch he's buying.",1677639948.0

Your background and profession should help quite a bit in that department. My wife and I both went through dealing with opioid use disorder, both going on 15+ years of active recovery. Early individual counseling and couples counseling was a huge help. Especially at the start of the recovery process. Like I mentioned, just educate yourself as much as possible on modern, evidence based treatment approaches to alcohol use disorder, and substance use disorders in general. Being aware of things like post acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS) which can, and often does, occur after the acute withdrawal phase is done, can help prevent lapses and relapses from occurring.

jaapznh,"Buprenorphine with naloxone (Suboxone) is a partial opioid agonist used in medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder. It is one of the only effective medications that can help a person suffering from addiction. In the vast majority of people, the fact that it's only a partial agonist and doesn't fully bind to the opioid receptors, there is no noticeable head change, high, or euphoria of any kind. The fact that buprenorphine has a very high affinity for the receptors it binds to, prevents other opioids from binding to the same receptor sites, so when people are on the medication, other opioids don't get them high. The naloxone in the medication doesn't pass the blood brain barrier when the medication is taken sublingually. The naloxone is there to prevent people from melting and injecting the strips. Its the same medication that's used to reverse opioid overdose, as it flushes the receptors when properly administered. I've been in active recovery for 15 years, I've been on doses as high as 32mg (first week of recovery) to as low as 2mg. The medication is extremely effective at helping your brain recover plasticity after addiction. It allows you to build support networks, and do all the other important parts of active recovery without worrying about acute withdrawal or post acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS). I've never had the urge to use more medication than I've been prescribed, or felt any kind of high or head chage while on the medication. It's one of the best tools available to treat the disease It's designed to treat.

Go around Narcotics Anonymous, to rooms full of people with 20-30+ years clean and say that about newcomers who are on methadone/suboxone and you'll get schooled by people with 10 times more clean time than you have. Fact of the matter is, if you haven't ever been on support meds, you have no idea what they feel like, and if you don't have a medical degree, you likely have no logical understanding of how they scientifically work, so you're utterly unqualified in any way to speak on the matter. If being clean was just not having your mind altered in any way, then coffee would be a relapse, or cigarettes, or antidepressants, or painkillers for terminal cancer patients, or drugs to put people in medical comas for surgery... being clean isn't just not being ""buzzed"", being clean is a conscious decision to not abuse drugs anymore. So how are people on methadone and suboxone not abusing drugs? Because, as long as they aren't doctor shopping for higher dosages, but instead have a relationship with a real medical doctor who prescribes them a drug to help their addiction, and as long as they take the drug as prescribed at the time they're supposed to, without double dosing it, skipping doses, or anything like that, than they are clean; that has been the consensus in my local Seattle Area Narcotics Anonymous, and frankly, it's the only position that makes sense. Clean time is a deeply personal thing and while the first step is to admit that we have a problem with drugs when it comes time to face our addiction, it is for each and every one of us to remain vigilant and define our own sobriety. Some people feel like coffee is a relapse for them, some people feel like they should reset their clean dates after surgery even if they didn't do anything wrong, and other people need support meds in the beginning. It isn't for you to define another person's sobriety, especially with a blanket statement that nobody on support meds is clean... if you go around communities of recovering addicts enough and keep spouting that nonsense, you'll meet some really great people who either are on support meds or were in the beginning and you'll quickly feel ashamed for saying those things. I have 228 days clean today and I have been on methadone the entire time; I haven't slipped one time, I've turned down dope multiple times, I take my dose as prescribed, and I have felt my mind come back to me and the fog of active addiction lift. I'm actually talking to my counselor about starting the process of tapering off. I don't know if I could have stayed clean this time without methadone, and there are definitely side effects, which is why I want to get off of it, but I've been clean for most of my adult life, and after a 2 year relapse, I got on methadone about a year ago for the first time, and coming from someone who has had 6+ year clean without methadone, I can tell you for a fact that abstaining from drugs while prescribed methadone, while a little different, is still a way of being clean. Nobody should be on this stuff forever, but it can save lives and help people come to recovery who were helpless to withdrawal, and methadone can also give older addicts at the end of their lives some comfort in their final days.",1677533917.0

My previous relapses since I went to my first rehab have always been at the longest a month but mostly just weeks. It seems like I am now stuck in a bad cycle. I know the nausea and sweats go away but my greatest fear (like I have said) is not having anything to numb the pain of losing my chosen family. I am terrified of facing it clean and sober. Also (although I’m not drinking) I was diagnosed with pancreatic insufficiency a few months ago where I have to take enzymes with everything that I eat for the rest of my life due to heavy drinking (and I’m only about to turn 30). My pancreas is permanently damaged. I’m also using to cope with this.",1677482594.0

Sure I can now skin a cat 1000 different ways, but there's more to do than just that. Get the help.",1677468657.0
ja5yryz,Thanks. Right now it sort of feels like I was just abandoned and of course not in a loving way. I have trauma of being abandoned (people close to me dying/ my Dad leaving (just packed up and disappeared) when I was only a teen and needed a male figure in my life). My family won’t respond even with me saying that I want help and that pain is something I do not want to feel. As soon as I feel it creeping back in I use again. They haven’t blocked me I just see that it’s been delivered. I’m not suicidal but I just feel like I don’t want to be alone and need to be somewhere where I can just focus completely on myself.

Organizing the financial and life stuff is hard though. I’ve thought about going to psych IP since that always seems to be the breaking point where help is like openly available but I’m not suicidal or reckless enough to get myself there. I’ll look into 30 days in my area and maybe hit up the needle exchange and see if they have any resources.

I feel feel like the more abuse the more wear and tear and harder it will be for your body to retain the healing ability.

Because even after being sober for like half a year my body still had a hard time digesting processed foods compared to unprocessed foods and I'd also be more nauseous.

ja471fg,"Well bear in mind, detox is specifically just that. It's just about getting you to the point where you're no longer physically dependent on the substance. My patients are usually in detox for 7 days, but severe cases stay longer. From there, they go to residential care, which is still in the facility but isn't considered ""hospital care"", so they aren't attended to by nurses anymore. They are still on medications, but they get them at a med station instead of administered bedside by the nurse. Certain medications are detox-only. Phenobarbital is definitely one of them. With your unique addiction, you may be on sedatives for 5-7 days. Once that's up, if you go into residential care, you'll have daily therapy sessions, group counseling and other mental health treatment. That can last up to 4 weeks, but it usually depends on what insurance will cover. It's honestly best to stay longer, at least 45 days and ideally 90. Most people just can't swing that though, unfortunately. From there, I usually recommends a PHP or IOP. PHP (partial hospitalization) is like residential except you sleep in your own bed at home. You still spend 8-12 hours each day getting treatment. IOP (intensive out-patient) is less of a time commitment, but still daily therapy and counseling. I also recommend at least a year in a sober living situation if you don't have a solid built-in support system. So if you don't have family living with you who can very actively support your recovery (manage finances, cover responsibilities so you can get to treatment/meetings, maybe even drive you around town), a sober house can help with that. Step one is to get into detox though. Preferably at a facility that does residential care as well, so probably not the hospital. Hospital detox works for getting you off the drugs, but outcomes beyond that are abysmal. Follow up intensive mental healthcare is critical. A lot of people have a hard time figuring out how to swing 45 days in treatment. I tell them all the same thing: if you had a cancer diagnosis that required you to be immediately hospitalized for a month in order to survive it, would you be able to find the time to make that work? Would you put it off because the timing wasn't right? Or would you move heaven and earth to get your ass into treatment? This is no different, you have a disease that is terminal if left untreated. There is literally nothing more important in your life right now, because your life is what is on the line. Take a medical leave of absence from work. Reach out for help from family and friends to manage your life while you're in treatment. Do whatever you have to do, whatever you would do if your addiction was a tumor.",1677437094.0

ja43sxw," As i mentioned, you need an addiction specialist, a doctor that specializes in addiction treatment, not a general practitioner. PAWS is not substance specific, it can occur in any individual that suffers from addiction to any substance or behavior. It is simply a symptom of a chronic illness. It has to do with the amount of time your brain plasticity needs to return to normal post active addiction. For brain plasticity to recover, your brain needs a long period of normal, stable, activity. That's generally referred to as being in ""active recovery."" Medication assisted treatment (MAT) is a very effective way to treat addiction. In addition to MAT, robust support networks, and individual counseling, again from counselors that specialize in addiction treatment, can help you build a foundation that allows you to stay in active recovery forever. I'm going on 15+ years in active recovery, and the tools I mentioned helped me get there. Edit: saw your answer about what you are withdrawing from. There are medications available to help with the withdrawal symptoms for most of those substances, find a doctor in the addiction treatment field and stop torturing yourself.",1677435852.0
ja3vhxo,"Understand. But if their brain is used to getting benzos everyday it will not suddenly be used to being without them 3 days later. Yes you eliminate the seizure risk, but what about the Gaba receptors that now suddenly don't have their daily benzo? Once the patient is released, their brain can take months if not years to recalibrate. In that time, they will most likely have severe anxiety/panic daily and probably relapse. I apologize if I sound argumentative. I don't mean to be. I am actually struggling myself currently and considering a hospital setting for help but don't know how to go about it. I'm petrified of it exactly for these reasons. I feel like sure I'll be off the mess in 3 days. But then I'll be released into a mental hell of psychological withdrawal. I developed an alcohol addiction to self medicate anxiety/depression a few months ago. My doctor put me on 2400 mg of gabapentin to get off alcohol. It worked for 2 weeks but then stopped and I started drinking again, all while still taking gabapentin. So I basically added another addiction. Now my anxiety is so bad that I've been given Diazepam. A 3rd drug. So question is... what can I possibly do now? Go to a 3 day detox and abruptly stop alcohol, gabapentin, and diazepam? I think I'd die under those circumstances and even if I survived, my mind would be panicked upon release without any sedating medications. I have the financial means to get private help, but I just can't find a ""caring"" environment with doctors/nurses that understand patient's really need help sometimes.

It could just be you have anxiety from getting clean and not adapting to regular life yet. Whether it's PAWs or anxiety, what you're experiencing is totally normal and it will go away, and you won't only get back to your previous ""baseline"", but you'll eventually reach a new peak and feel better than you ever have in your life, as long as you stay clean and keep working on your life. Also if you haven't done counseling, outpatient treatment, or Narcotics Anonymous/Alcoholics Anonymous, I HIGHLY suggest trying one or all of them out. It's important to have real face to face time with other people who are staying clean just like you are so you can hear about their struggles and achievements and have people you can relate to so you know you aren't going crazy. Plus a counselor can help out tons with helping you heal the parts of yourself that drove you to addiction in the first place. We addicts all have parts of us inside that are hurt and no matter what we do to try and move on from them or cover them up, whether with drugs, work, or relationships, we need to heal those fundamental parts of ourselves otherwise it's really likely that we'll either relapse again or end up miserable.",1677423715.0

ja0vdgn,"Recovery is a really long process; it's &awesome& that you actually realize you're still not 199%, as that means you still have so much more progress to make :) It's different for everyone, but there are two main aspects: physical and mental. Physically, the best thing to do is to get into weight lifting in order to restore your body to a healthy state. Lifting weights will restore all of the massive muscle atrophy caused by meth, as well as rebuilding the neuronal network due to the effects of hypertrophy. It's critical to eat a high protein, high carb, regular fat diet while doing this to give the body enough energy rebuild. Mentally,, counseling, self help groups, and a healthy lifestyle with a solid balance between work, friends/family, and hobbies :) Romance is important too after you get back to 100%, but my personal opinion is to just take it slow, and don't let romance be something that you're in a rush to get into :) I know it sounds like a lot, but recovery is basically training the brain and body how to live a healthy life, and things don't just magically get better on their own... but I promise things get so much easier and life gets so much better so just hang in there :)",1677371116.0

ja00sfd,"Hey man, that all makes perfect sense. By that I mean your head is in the right place. I think different people are going to have different ways of looking at this. Here's my take. Perhaps rather than ""two different"" lives just look at it as having two different social groups. Like in high school when you maybe have some friends who are in band and some on the football team. To be clear that's just a lose ""metaphor"" lol. What I'm getting at is that there will be some separation between say co-workers/friends outside of recovery and those within. I don't like using the word ""normal"" (which is a whole other thing) but ""normal"" people usually aren't going to get the way we process feelings/thought, triggers, repercussions, etc that people in recovery have. They just haven't had that experience and they won't be able to to relate on the same level. A lot of them might not even want to and that is perfectly ok. Nobody has to change anything about themselves based on our recovery/experience. This is how I look at it. I'm a carpenter, my brother is a physical therapist. Our backgrounds mean we have two separate sets of experiences. We send each other memes/funny posts on Instagram based on these experiences. I don't understand some of the ones he sends and he doesn't understand some I send him. This doesn't mean we live completely separate lives. There is so much overlap outside of our work/educational experiences where we relate to one another. The overlap is where we support each other. If he has a problem figuring out what is wrong with one of his patients, I'm not the guy lol. If I need to figure out how to frame up a wall in an odd location, he isn't the guy. We have different support groups in these situations. So not everyone at work is going to know how to support your recovery. That's ok. That's why we have our recovery communities. There's a difference between ""knowing how"" and ""wanting to"" however. If people in your life outside of recovery, don't want to support it, that's just shitty. It does happen. Again, we can't control other people. We can't make them support us. No matter if it's friends, co-workers, significant others or family. What we can do is ask them to respect our recovery. This isn't attempting to control anyone but it is still setting an expectation. A reasonable one however. When someone refuses to respect our recovery, it could be time to burn a bridge so to speak. At the same time we, can't always do this. It might not be possible to burn a bridge with a co-worker or a family member. This is when we fall back on the support in our recovery communities. It might feel like a lot to manage but that's what recovery is all about. The amazing thing is that if we work a program of recovery, most of this stuff just works itself out. It's work, so it's not necessarily easy but it does get so much better! This is why I would encourage you to just be honest about being in recovery. Just live it! Don't expect anyone to treat you differently or live any differently. You just do you. When I first got sober, I wore that sobriety like a suit of armor. Maybe a bit too much but fuck it, it worked. I was quick to let people know I was sober because it helped keep me sober. 3 years later I'm far more casual because I can be. I have some time and a solid recovery support/friend group. When someone new offers me a beer I just say, ""thanks but I'm good"". Someone sparks up a bowl around me at a BBQ I'll say, ""damn that shit smells nuts!"" ""You wanna hit?"" ""Nah man, I'm chillin on that stuff these days, Imma go grab some food or w/e"". I might get a weird look or two occasionally but ya know what? In 5min they are gonna forget that entire interaction happened. Overall I'd say that ""stigma"" is built up in your head a bit but as I said in the beginning, you're heads in the right place. I was the same way and it's why I wore my ""sobriety armor"" for awhile. It doesn't have to be forever. I mean, it might be and that's completely ok. It works for some people in recovery. Other's are just super fired up about all of it. That's great, I love it. W/e makes their lives better than one of active addiction/alcoholism. Over 3 years I've built up a decent program, solid friends in recovery and various means of support. I don't feel the need for the armor anymore. I have a program that keeps me aware of things that endanger my recovery. When they crop up, I make a tactical retreat to the support I have. With that support I can get back to and face any challenge life throws at me. Welcome to ""Reddit Recovery"" lol. Keep building up these various support groups. Get a couple solid recovery buddies in your life. Go do shit. Bowling, paintball, watch football games, go out to eat and go to meetings.

j9zgxpj,"I'm a parent of a 30 yr old, and for the past 10 years, I have helped my family member I will refer to as X with recovery. When I first discovered they were addicted to opiates, I researched everything I could find about treatment and recovery: detox, inpatient, intensive outpatient, AA, medically assisted treatment (MAT) suboxone and vivatrol, therapy. Have faith - you can do this. It is possible for you to get sober and move on with your life as a productive person. Here's what helped my family member. Please take care of yourself first. You cannot help your family members if you are sick. This is a disease, and you need treatment. Your mother and grandfather will have to help themselves. My advice is based on 10 years of experience trying to find what works. Please off methadone! it's poison and there are better meds out there that can help you. Suboxone is a daily med, and vivitrol is an injection that stays in your system for approximately 28 days. Both curb cravings to use. 1. Detox - Go to a detox program. Don't try to do it on your own because it is dangerous. Roughly 7 days under supervision to help you get through it. You need to have your vitals checked to make sure you are safely detoxing. If possible, while there get a psych evaluation to see if you also have depression or bipolar. While there, ask them to find a bed for you in a 21-28 day intensive inpatient program. Best program is on that has doctors, not just counselors. Also, when you get out you need to go on meds immediately so you don't relapse. You will need prescription for Suboxone, vititrol or something else, but please do not go back to methodone! 2. Inpatient - Stay in for the full time, 21 - 28 days. Away from home, you can focus on your recovery, away from temptations and from family stresses. YOu need to take care of you. While there, see if there is a halfway house you can get into. 3. Halfway house or home. If you go home get on meds asap and find AA meetings to go to daily. Get a sponsor and work the steps - find someone who can go through them with you in a few months - not years. X told me the recovery success rate AA 75-80% back when groups used the big book. Now most meetings are about sharing feelings, what caused you to use, etc. X said he learned that's not what caused your addiction - it's a brain thing. Period. Talking about feelings won't get you sober. Follow the big book - it honest to God works. He has seen it work and he wants to find serenity too. Find a higher power, God, Buddah, whoever to believe in. Ask them for help. Find an outside activity - go to school, volunteer, stay busy. There are some great podcasts. I believe in you.",1677349807.0
j9yuu21,"Glad to hear you were straightforward with the owner and your managers. That was 100% a good move. I can agree with the sentiment that you aren't obligated to tell everyone you know that you're in recovery. In my experience however, the best practice is to give the people close to you a heads up. Again, not necessarily a facebook post or the beginning to every conversation but when the moment presents itself, be honest. For example, this girl invites you to the club. Your not going to go because it might jeopardize your recovery, living situation, job, progress, etc. It's just not your scene right now. You could be dishonest, make an excuse and say you can't go this time. What happens if she invites you again? If you keep making excuses it will eventually ""get weird"". She will come to her own conclusion as to why you don't want to go. That a specific example but has general applications. 99% of the time being dishonest will create more issues down the road. An example of the 1% would be a situation where one might loose their job if they told an employer that they were an alcoholic/addict. This is one reason why 12step programs are anonymous. You didn't have this issue and thankfully many don't. The stigma around addiction has lessened and the more honest we are about it, the more it will subside. I'm not sure what the person above means by saying, ""being honest can mean putting other people first"". I'm actually going to have to edit that quote in a moment as I'm on mobile, cant see the post and dont remember how they put it. I'm going to ask them directly as well. In regards to your situation I'd just be honest. You don't have to fully explain your situation if you don't want. You can just say something along the lines of, ""It would be cool to hang out but I'm not drinking right now and the club probably wouldn't be a great time."" At the very least, she knows what's up and doesn't think you don't want to hang out with her. Will word get around? Probably but you can't control what other people think. I don't see a reason for you to lie about where you are in life right now. It just is what it is. If you're serious about your recovery it just doesn't matter and will help keep you out of other situations where you might be tempted to drink or drug. That being said it is tougher when you are younger. I'm in my early 30's so I feel for you lol. The aforementioned stigma is a little more applicable. Again, thankfully not in a way where people always think we are complete pieces of shit. It's more of a, ""they don't drink so they might not be as much fun"" kinda thing. We can't control what other people think though. What you can do is just continue to be you. Yall see each other at work and the way you act doesn't need to change. Its how yall met to begin with right? Once you have some solid recovery under your belt theres not reason you wont be able to go anywhere or do anything. At three years I do all kinds of things I wouldn't have done in my first. All kinds of things I couldn't do with the weight of my addiction on my shoulders either. I've traveled all over the country and visited Spain. I chop it up with the boys at BBQ's, paintball trips and football games. I go to bars when I have a reason to be there. For example when a co-worker is leaving and everyone goes out to celebrate. Hell, I play beer pong with buddies and just don't drink! I'm not suggesting that things like beer pong are great ideas for everyone in recovery. That's just been my experience. I wanted to share that as an ""extreme"" example as how life doesn't just stop being fun when we get sober. Focus on your recovery my guy, get some time under your belt.

j9ygbtm,"My suggestion to such to suboxone is based on personal experience. I was abusing methadone and oxys for a few years. I could and would have stayed on methadone the rest of my life had I not gotten on subs. I didn't do bad on subs. Got a bladder infection from them. Until I got down to a good maintenance dose I barely slept 5 hours a night but was never tired. I was actually extra hyper for a few months (I'm on the hyperactive side to begin with). Missed a dose once and that was hell. I called my wife from work begging her to bring my dose when I started going into withdrawal (she brought it ASAP). I took 6 months to taper off. Noticed every drop after a few days but it was manageable. Having a regular exercise routine during the taper helped a lot. When I finally got off I stopped exercising for a bit. Getting back into it after a month or so after stopping subs helped get fully back to normal. One of the biggest things I noticed with subs is exercise, good meals, sexual activity, and positive social interactions felt great again. Those things are huge in recovery and were all able to trigger the reward centers in my brain again. Everyone's experience is different but it's what worked for me. OP is on a huge methadone dose and it's destroying him. He should certainly talk to his therapist and doctors about where he's at and where he wants to be. Maybe lowering the methadone dose will do it for him, maybe going to subs is the answer. Something needs to change though and I hope whatever happens gets the result he's looking for.",1677334553.0
j9xxmma,"I think for me, I have to constantly accept the fact that I am an addict. And I do mean constantly, because after I write this comment I will probably forget that quickly. I get lost in my head a lot, because of the trauma and mental scars I created through my drug use and now I have to not only work a 12 step program, but seek out good psychological treatment to get back to living life without being sad all the time. I think that this is a lot for anyone to handle. I know another guy who has to work a 12 step program, and then has to do community service for probation. And another who has to keep up with her law firm. And another who has to be a single parent to 4 kids, whilst being a project manager. Another has HIV and has to go out of his way to stay healthy to not get sick all the time. I don't see, how I could HAVE A CHANCE at accepting any of these problems and deal with them accordingly (if they were my own), if I'm not sober. I go to AA, because I want to live while I'm living, instead of dying before I get to live. I was forced to approach things spiritually, against my own will, and now its the greatest fact of my life. Get to and find your own AA community. When you get there, find out what you can do to help. Make some coffee. Clean the bathrooms.

j9xvpc8,"What state do you live in? Most states offer some form of free healthcare, and state insurance always covers detox and rehab. Even if your state doesn't, thank god for Obamacare!_HYPERLINK_ _HYPERLINK_ just looked it up, if your income is under $16,000 you can sign up for free healthcare through the federal government. But like I said go with your state first. Professional help is extremely valuable, I've done tons of counseling/treatment/self help groups over my life and they have done wonders for me; I'm still not perfect because nobody is, but yeah. Trust me, this whole school thing is a neurosis, you're blowing it way out of proportion. School does not equal success, there are tons of billionaires who never went to college, hell I'm sure some never finished high school. My grand dad who raised me got D's in high school and was a self made millionaire. The trick is, you gotta' stop wasting your energy worrying about the past and the future, just take all of your energy and focus on just the next thing you need to do in your life, that's it. These recurring nightmares and all your anxiety is just a manifestation of all the mental energy you invest in replaying past failures and/or future tripping. Just take all that energy and focus on getting signed up for health care, or finding out whatever you need to do to get into detox, inpatient, and IOP/Counseling, Also NA/AA meetings are a GOD SEND, they changed my life, and I highly recommend going at least 3 times a week once you're stable for at least the first couple years. then get into some clean and sober housing, and everything else will work itself out as long as you just set small goals like that and tackle them one by one.",1677320309.0
j9xnu9a,"So you have what most addicts have, it's called polysubstance abuse disorder; If you ever read some Narcotics Anonymous Literature it will make a lot of sense to you. It talks about addiction as a disease that starts out when we're young before we even take our first drug, and it drives us to feel a need to alter our consciousness to escape from our feelings by any means necessary. I was the same, started with weed/oxycontin at 14, then acid and shrooms and drinking and then meth and heroin... I also struggled with a Benadryl analogue called Hydroxyzine that does the same thing, also got stomach issues regularly. I even used Nutmeg to get high for a few months when I was a kid and I found out it feels just like weed. So good job kicking meth and heroin, but try and look at a drug as a drug in term of what it does to your mental health. I can tell you I've found a great deal of hope and success by just staying clean as long as possible, and also doing tons of counseling, inpatient/outpatient treatment, and NA/AA and other forms of support. The longer you stay clean and the more counseling you do, the better things get; eventually that feeling of always needing to be out of your head will go away, if you just stick with it.

It’s what helped me get over the guilt and shame of my past and helped me find some confidence, self esteem, and self worth. I couldn’t look people in the eye, I was constantly replaying my past actions in my head and was scared to death of running into someone I might’ve hurt or embarrassed myself in front of.

That said. I do believe doing that 2 week taper and going down just .25 at a time is very close to what a doctor would recommend given how long you’ve been on it. I generally think you’d be safe, you’d most likely experience some anxiety, aching, restlessness, etc. but I don’t think you’d be at risk for anything life threatening.

j9rl6yz,"yes, i think the underlying point it that if its ""not a problem"" then it should be ""no big deal"" to let it go in order to support making a change for something that is a ""major problem"". For example, it is going to be hard for a doctor to accurately assess and diagnose mental health disorders when people continue to frequently use substances. People can say they don't want to do that. It ok. It's their opinion but it doesn't make it real or a fact. It's could be an excuse because they can't do it. Their brain/perception rationalizes it as just a simple desire they are fulfilling rather than challenge that. Because thats how substances work lol. It is something at least worth considering that our perceptions on self might be wrong. And that our judgment could be influenced by substances and their effects even if we are sober in the moment. If that is true, its just a desire, then it seems incredibly immature and irresponsible. ""Try this thing for a year. It might help support changing something that is wrecking your life and health, help you to learn some coping skills so you don't have to backtrack."" ""no. I don't want to because reasons."" Even so, that gives the counselor a new angle to help their client address ambivalence, so its not a bad thing. Its still good to even be discussing it and thinking about change. Of course the answer to not wanting to stop everything even temporarily is that ""its no big deal"" and ""never had a problem"". Convenient and simple, it just rolls off the tongue without a thought lol. People can do whatever they want, including shooting dope in the gutter until they OD and die. It doesn't change my life and I don't have a strong opinion on the choices they make. No judgement. Just saying, I think it can be a good idea to get a total reset and maintain it for a year. No offense to anyone struggling but a year of sobriety aint shit for time compared to the rest of your life, assuming you aren't on your death bed right now. After a year you might find you don't want substances anymore or if you do you have hopefully established a new relationship with them and yourself.

j9ibb7b,"The label “addict” isn’t all that helpful—if the cons of using substances have started outweighing the pros, and you still do not stop, that is a good indicator that you cannot stop on your own, and therefore need help. That is if you want to stop. Which is a tough question because if you are in fact at a stage where you keep using notwithstanding the net negative consequences of doing so, of course there is going to be a large part of you that wants to keep going. Not to mention your quite valid point that the drugs are helping you cope. The good thing about rehab or even just attending, say, a 12-step meeting every day for your first 90 days of sobriety and hearing a good message there and working with a sponsor, is that those types of things, in their best forms, help you change your way of looking at yourself and the world in a way that helps you just take it easy and learn to not be so hard on yourself, one day at a time. So, even though right now it seems impossible to cope without drugs (I get it), if you get the right help, and show up and listen for that help, you will get to a point where you will be able to get through each day perfectly capably without even the thought of drugs beyond a passing memory here and there. I totally get why you find your friends and family so annoying right now (I have been on your side before), but they only are bringing this up because they love you—don’t know them but I don’t have to to know that. It’s not easy to confront someone over substance use, so they are doing this all for you (been on their side, too). As I said, it is completely valid that you would be resistant to wanting to stop right now, even if you do need help. But if my experience is indicative, a lot of those friends and family are gonna start pulling away, and you will find yourself becoming more and more isolated, making it that much deeper of a hole to climb out of, however deep it might otherwise be or get for you. Really wishing you vibes and an open mind. Peace and be well, and above all, stay safe and if you’re gonna be out there, at least be careful out there. PS If/when you do get help, here are a couple humble suggestions based only on my own experience of what has worked for me: At meetings, make sure to find a good group of people with long term sobriety whose examples and stories can provide a blueprint. Bonus if those same people with good sobriety are also people whom you can relate to on a personal level, because it’ll be more likely to stick if you actually enjoy it (ps: you won’t be likely to enjoy anything when you’re first getting off of drugs, it sucks. It’s ok to eat sugar and junk food and watch trashy tv to get through those first 30 days or so).",1677039146.0

I white knuckled it for the whole time and was incredibly unhappy. After about 3 more rounds of treatment I realized you have to believe in something bigger than yourself. What's been helping me is to believe everyone believes in the same god/higher power we just do it differently. Personally my ""higher power"" is an all loving, all understanding, all powerful being. It is hard to believe in one when so much bad shit happens in the world... child cancer, abuse, genocide. What God makes that shit? Idk but I don't think it's God's work.

j9gezu6,"I’m doing alright, thanks. I am down to .75mg/day and not feeling too much pain. The initial drop was definitely the hardest for me so far. Each additional .25 drop has caused about 1-2 days of pretty bad withdrawals but I generally feel okay after a few days. I dropped from 1mg to to .75mg/day last Tuesday. Didn’t sleep much the first two nights, stayed on the couch most of the weekend, but went for a workout yesterday and am already feeling settled into my new dose. So far, it’s difficult to determine how the tapering is affecting me. A lot of my thoughts and emotions are clouded by the withdrawals. I do think Klonopin was a miracle drug for me - but only at the time I started taking it. I was severely depressed and barely sleeping at the time. My nighttime anxiety was at an all time high. The klonopin dulled my anxiety and allowed me to sleep, and I was happier because of that. However, I can see now that I outgrew my need for it many years ago. But my body and mind were locked into this idea that I absolutely needed the Klonopin to be happy and functional. As I go off of it, I’ve noticed a couple things: 1. I am finding more value in things that, because of the emotional numbness caused by Klonopin, didn’t feel as important to me before. For example, I have suddenly felt the urge to reach out to old friends that I used to be close with. I am more inclined to pick up the phone and talk to my family. As the Klonopin leaves my system, I am beginning to treasure my personal relationships more than I ever have. It’s really exciting to feel that connection again. It’s almost as if my threshold to achieve happiness is going down. Simple things now bring me loads of joy - things I would’ve brushed off for the many years while my emotions were dulled. I can only hope this feeling continues to get stronger as I continue my taper. It’s pretty incredible. 2. I have not been able to find any medical evidence to back this up, but I have seen other Reddit users say the same thing: my panic attacks are actually going away as I go off the Klonopin. I know that sounds crazy, but it’s true. Not only are they less frequent, but they are way less intense and only last a few seconds. I think I got stuck in a loop where I felt like the Klonopin was the only thing to help my panic attacks. Which in turn caused a false feeling of “I need klonopin BECAUSE I get panic attacks”. So whenever I didn’t have klonopin in my system or nearby, my body would automatically shift into panic mode and throw some gnarly attacks at me that could only be fixed by popping a pill. As I undo that way of thinking, I’ve found that I really don’t have as much panic as I thought I did. Now that I am less reliant on klonopin, my mind has settled into a state of “I don’t need the klonopin because my panic attacks aren’t that bad anymore.” I was not expecting this sort of chain reaction, but it’s amazing! The less klonopin I think I need, the less panic I think I have. But I would’ve never come to this realization without starting to get the klonopin out of the picture first. I know this won’t be everyone’s experience, but for me, going off klonopin has caused my anxiety to drop significantly. It’s truly a liberating feeling - the closest I can relate to “getting my life back” so far. As I am relearning to become more in touch with my emotions, I have decided that I want to move closer to home and be near my friends, family, and loved ones. I am rejoining a life that I once loved and treasured, but had forgotten how much I valued because my emotions have been suppressed. That has been my experience so far. On top of the awful withdrawals, I am already feeling a big warm light turning on inside me. It’s a very strange and sometimes overwhelming feeling, but very comforting and it reassures me that I’m doing the right thing. I do think Klonopin can be a miracle drug for many individuals. Just take caution when going on it. I am certainly not the first and won’t be the last to have an issue with dependency. It’s almost guaranteed if you decide to stay on it for longer than just a couple weeks. I’d say explore other options outside of benzos before taking that route. And if it turns out that you do need benzos, that’s totally fine! My best advice would be to try not to let them overstay their welcome. You might be doing yourself a disservice by not learning to cope with your anxiety in ways other than taking klonopin. Check out some studies done on the effects of long term klonopin use and keep that all in mind when going on it. Be prepared to become dependent. But if you find that it helps you live a better life, that is also something to consider. Just be careful.",1677007753.0

I've been on this ""am I really the a-word or do I just self-medicate"" journey for...maybe 10 years now, which is sort of shocking and upsetting to look back on, but definitely for the last 5 years my drinking has been a real problem in my life (even though I stopped drinking when I was pregnant; I thought, no, I don't have a problem! Look, I stopped! Then, well, I started again worse than ever). Learning that ""use dependence"" or ""use disorder"" are often preferred to ""alcoholic"" or ""addict"" actually helped. My gut reaction to those words ran so deep, and the new terms were also more clearly accurate. Am I dependent on this? Does this use seem disordered? Well...yeah. And why am I depending on it? If I had a prescribed medication with this many side effects I would mostly likely stop taking it, recommended or not, so why am I going so far out of my way to protect this form of self-medication? And there are a lot of answers to that question but I think the main one is...I don't possess a better way to cope with these problems, and finding one is hard.

j9em4nq,"What an unbelievable story you guys shared! I used to dabble in the RCs back in the early 2010s but I never found any place to sell RC opiates. That was always my dream but they were hard to procure, i never did try to order off the darkweb though because I was afraid of getting caught and didnt understand the technology very well, but i did see the fentanyl analogues you've mentioned there. I got hooked on a-pvp for about 6 months though and that shit was brutal. Not hard to w/d from but very easy to OD on and I would find myself holding my heart and rocking back and forth for hours, focusing on my breathing and hoping I wouldnt die. More recently, I took tramadol for a few months daily at 300mg per day. That was hard for me to come to terms with as I had been clean from any hard drugs for almost 5 years, but shit happens. Then I went to Thailand for 3 months and figured I might as well shift from Trams to Kratom. That was mistake in my opinion. Maybe short term would have been fine but quitting Kratom after 3 months of dosing strong tea 3x a day (which may have additionally been mixed with medications as well) was brutal. All of the alkaloids in Kratom make it hard to quit. It does alot to the body that a classic opiate does not. In my experience, it would be better to shift to from kratom to codeine, then taper codein down to 120mgs and then quit. That would be SUPER easy to w/d. Kratom at my dose was hard and it was impossible for me to taper, my mind would not allow me to take less no matter how many days i had planned to. My w/d was 4 days of acute with all the classical symptoms, 7 days of restless leg syndrome (with virtually no sleep), and 14 days of sleep disturbances (maybe 3-4 hours of sleep and before waking up). I also used some benzos for sleep which didnt actually help to sleep longer, but only made the psychological component of not sleeping easier to bare. I also used cannabis tea for the first 12 days or so - this I would recommend if you are not the type of person who get anxiety attacks from cannabis. I was suprised that I needed a higher dose when coming off kratom, around 25mg thc to even get stoned. This is abnormal because I used to get stoned off 15 mg easily when i was living a opiate free life. Anyways, just wanted to give my 2 cents for you guys coming of kratom. I would recommend dosing cannabis tea/edible right before dinner and having benzos close by in case you need them after that. I had alprazolam for sleep and clonazepam for days when I just needed to take the edge off of the whole day. However, as a rule of thumb I always used the minimum dosage of benzos the entire withdrawl. I tried to go most of the day without and just dose 0.5mg at night when needed. I also used Lyrica a few days here and there so that I could have a little 'vacation' from the depression. Once each weekend I dosed 375mgs and enjoyed being a bit loopy all day. Lyrica is great for withdrawls. It will get you through 24 hours pain free. It's actually best to take it on day 1 or 2 of opiate withdrawls as you will mostly forget you are even experiencing any! however, it will not work well if you redose it more often than once a week (and is super dangerous to w/d from itself, so should not be taken daily).

j9chqhx,"Not sure if it will help in the short term but I just wanted to chime in to say that I've reconnected with several friends I used to drink heavily with in college. When you quit using/drinking you end up finding out who your real friends are and who was just a drinking buddy. There are plenty of people I used to get into trouble with that I would have no interest in reconnecting with but the real ones were still there once I came back after living out of state for nearly a decade. My advice would be to get some clean time under your belt before testing the waters, don't try to be one of the people that posts on SD about how they're going to try to go on the booze cruise with all of their old drinking buddies at 3 weeks sober. Most people in early recovery are also desperate to find sober connections, I encourage you to find these people but just make sure you always keep in mind that many will relapse and you have to be ready to cut and run if they do. It's like saving someone who is drowning, if you're not a badass swimmer with a ton of experience they're going to pull you under with them. Make an effort with those old friends who are willing to hang out sober, but those people who can't go a day without getting fucked up are going to be dangerous.

When I go out I always ""know my evacuation route"" by doing things like driving on my own, I don't want to be DD because drunks are exhausting and I want to be able to slip out if people end up getting too crazy. When I first quit drinking I told my therapist I wanted to get to a point where I could go to bars and things without drinking, once I got some time I realized I had no interest in most of that.

Meanwhile what's actually happening is the Xanax is _causing_ your anxiety with its absence. That is - the anxiety you're feeling when you don't have a Xanax is _not_ the same anxiety you felt before you started using them - it's much worse. It will continue to get worse the more you lean into them. It's exactly the opposite of what you tell yourself - they don't relieve your stress in those high stress situations, they _add_ to it, make it worse, with their absence. They will continue to get the hooks in ever deeper the more you rely on them. If you can start to believe the opposite is happening you'll be able to start pushing back from a place of conviction, rather than an ever growing helplessness. And in reality it doesn't take faith or belief - after a few months without them your brain chemistry will start to rebalance and situations that were previously intolerable will slowly become less so. You'll start to trust yourself again, and natural confidence will start to return. It's better than that even - if you continue, you'll have proof you're stronger, more capable, and more resilient than you gave yourself credit for. It's a self fulfilling prophecy, just as continuing in the other direction will be for the opposite reasons.

Consider joining a district level meeting to learn more about how you can try to change AA for the better like how we just changed the preamble to say “people” instead of “men and women.” Everything takes work and nothing is free, my friend. Yoooo, chill out. First off, alcoholics are self proclaimed flawed people. As a community with a design for group decision making, tradition 2, that means things are going to change slowly. That is ultimately for the best, though some people might be ready sooner than others. AA also isn’t for everyone, but we just got around to changing the preamble to “Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of PEOPLE who share…” and that’s honestly a big deal. It’s evidence that the group IS moving forward from where we started. Not to mention there are different editions because several changes have been made to grow with the times better. Idk what you think fuming is going to do to help you stay sober though. Everyone has their own pace, but being mad and judgy is a drinking recipe. I try to take note of what I think should happen for the ultimate health of AA, specifically so I have access to the higher power that saved me from all my drinking recipes, which means it has to continue to grow in numbers, and put my energies towards that. If we’re trying to save ourselves, we need other alcoholics. So we need to be accepting. Not angry and righteous. Have you participated in the district meetings? are you on a service board or committee? Do you actually lift your fingers to change this world to better suit alcoholics in recovery that you pray will help other still? The fight is over. If you still have a flag to wave other than a white one, I hope you ticket out quickly for your sake. Also, a lot of AA is just recognizing context. Using the steps to determine what went wrong in the daily routine. Finding where we need to be and when we need to be there to protect ourselves and the rest of the world from us when we get too hungry, angry, lonely or tired. Those four things trigger resentment, dishonesty, self centeredness and fear. Those four things combine into deluding ourself that drinking will solve anything important. If you get angry about something, which I agree with you in this case, don’t suffer the indignant posts and fuming nature for something you are using to nurse yourself back to spiritual health not being perfect. And lastly, the paper trail is very important. When you read page 86 before you got to TO WIVES, did you start doing its instructions every night and morning? If you did, you now have a paper trail for every day that you have lived imperfectly through. If you find any behavioral patterns occurring in your daily life that seem to baffle you to the point of wanting to drink, go look at the paper work to find out wtf is going wrong, then make small sensible changes to the routine so that you distance yourself from the insanity and have a better chance of being of service. Maybe your service could be helping change the diction of our literature. The same is true for the fellowship as a unit. AA is just as imperfect as all of its occupants combined, so get ready for a bumpy ride. Where you stand up with all the anger and determination to get “TO WIVES” changed to “TO LOVED ONES” or whatever you and the majority decide, it may go wonderfully! It might even get us to change fellowship to alcoholicship, we’re not all fellows, amiright? If we do something stupid that doesn’t work for the purpose of stopping drinking, then we have a paper trail. “Be quick to see where religious people are right.” Praying and meditating on that sentence turned out very effective for my growth, so I used the same sentence except I changed it from “religious people” to “dumb people,” “angry people,” “people I disagree with…” you get the idea.",1676789845.0

I see it as historical and perfect in its own way of imperfections. To me, it means that I wanted to extract the knowledge and got through parts I don’t agree with. That describes my life most days. I don’t agree with much of the shit that goes in but I still can find the useful nuggets that help me as they’ve helped others.

Meditation assisted treatment (MAT) along with individual counseling and building a solid support network will help you get into and stay in active recovery.

j92nkm0,"... it's the chapter that Alanon was based on. Perhaps it could be better titled as ""to the partners"", but it's part of Lois' contribution to the book. Bill and Lois sacrificed a lot to persue their beliefs about helping alcoholics, Lois especially. This book was written in the 1930's, it's going to reflect that time period and how things were. The fact is, women were in a different position then, and they were often the ones who had to deal with the alcoholics consequences, thus the chapter is named ""to the wives"". There's also one titled 'to the employers' ... There was a big kerfuffle about changing all the 'he's and him's' to 'they's and them's' a few years back at the world service conference. If you're passionate enough about changing it, then bring your case to the local, state and national conferences. It takes a LOT to change anything in the book, and the last time we had an uprising of people who wanted it changed, it was decided 'nay' due to the cost of reprinting and distribution of new books. It's in the millions of dollars range. Are you capable of raising that much money for your cause as well? So, perhaps consider how much work it takes to change something that's been argued about and upheld for nearly 100 years. Are you that dedicated to altering a book/program that has been defended by old-timers who are dead set in their ways? Or are you complaining about free help for alcoholics because you don't agree with they way history unfolded nearly a century ago? There's a page in the back, that talks about how ""Acceptance is the Key"", perhaps read that page instead. All too often new comers want to come in and start changing things in AA because it doesn't suit them or offends their delicate sensibilities.. the truth is, AA teaches us how to become emotionally mature adults so we don't have to go out throwing temper tantrums drinking ourselves to death and destroying other people's lives everyday because we got our feathers ruffled a little bit. One day at a time. Take what you need and leave the rest. Take it easy. HOW. Honesty, open-mindedness, and willingness. FEAR: can be Fuck Everything And Run, OR Face Everything And Recover.

j8r589j,"Hi! Thanks for sharing your story - I see so much of myself in your post. It sounds like you have an awareness that the way you are currently living your life is destructive to your overall well-being and mental health, and that you want to change. I know from experience that the hell you’re living in only gets better by getting brutally honest with yourself. You have to ask yourself, “What am I escaping from?” and “Do I like who I am?”. You might find a hole/void in your life that substances make you forget about temporarily, only to create more of a mess to heal from. And addiction is a brutal disease that unless you get help to heal from it, typically doesn’t end well. Jail or death. There is no living with active addiction. As a counselor in training with a psychoanalytic theoretical orientation, I believe looking at your early childhood experiences and parental attachments will provide valuable insights into how you developed your sense of Self. Did your parents nurture you? Did they model secure, loving relationships? Is there a history of substance abuse in your family? So many of us have traumas from our childhoods that we internalize. We develop skewed attitudes and beliefs about ourselves which create patterns of instability and harmful behaviors. None of it was your fault, but becomes your responsibility. It’s a miracle I lived through my 20s at all, let alone made it through my 30s with only one divorce and a drinking problem. I’d been escaping my past my whole life, have lost friends to overdoses, and more friends who I couldn’t watch slowly kill themselves because it was just too painful and we can’t make people want to get help. It’s a choice people need to make for themselves. And you can’t do it alone. It’s just too much - physically, emotionally, spiritually - to take on without support. Recovery isn’t easy, but it sounds like the way things have been going hasn’t been either. I know it’s scary to imagine your life without substances. I still struggle with this! Who am I if not a total mess who hates myself? But building a lifestyle / relationships that support your destruction solves nothing. You have to manufacture some self worth and distance yourself from people who don’t have your best interests at heart. There is a level of experimentation that comes with youth and I think it’s healthy to some extent. But it doesn’t take long for things to progress to full blown addiction. Fentanyl is a HUGE problem that’s killing hundreds of thousands of people every year and is only getting worse. Kids are accidentally overdosing on the stuff thinking it’s coke or heroin. The tiniest little amount is lethal. It’s terrifying! Love yourself. Find support through this (like an intensive outpatient program). Envision a life without this pain and chaos.

Unlike other doctors blaming ""paws"" for 2 years (when I didn't even have a chemical dependency on alcohol to begin with), he saw the lack of functioning and mood swings as severe side effects. Unlike other doctors, he believed me when I said I used to be able to function and remember things. That said, I stuck to your advice to find the right meds and to not touch the weed. I've had a pretty good time doing so. And the regimen finally clicked! Now, the next thing my doctor out of IOP wants to do is address the long-term issue of sleep.

Its not for your wife, or your family or job or whatever, you are doing it because you want to make your life manageable and recognize that having a relationship with your wife and family again is a result of achieving that. I highly recommend a substance abuse therapist that you can talk to as the road can be a tough one and having that outside voice will help keep you in check. Was super depressed and the first year for me was very hard as I was having to deal with the consequences I caused when I was high so it will feel like ""even when I am clean my life still sucks so I might as well be high while it happens!"" But this is the drugs lying to you. You ended up here cause you started to use. Its gonna take time but things will start to fall back into place with time and effort. Some people may not accept you back into your life and that will hurt a lot, but you need to respect that as we have done terrible things to these people in their lives and to forgive is a tall order. On that last note, forgive yourself and learn to love yourself. I struggle with this one myself as I have never really had a good self esteem and a low opinion of my self worth which contributed to my use of heroin, but continuing to beat yourself up wont help anything.

You need to take the hint though. He didn’t initially want you in. Period. Maybe you think that this is because his therapist is telling him not to let you in, and maybe the therapist did say something, but at the end of the day he is an adult. And if an adult tells you they don’t want to let you in, you should just leave. That’s the right thing to do. Many people, myself included, have a very difficult time turning away friends/family when they turn up at your home. Regardless of whether you actually want to spend time with them at the moment.

I was in active addiction for 1 year, 1 year clean, then another 3 years in addiction. I’ve now been sober for 6 weeks. Things have been going so well for me that I can’t even fathom going back to the state that I was in.

I have to put a lot of focus on myself, my mental health, and self care. Im always looking for ways to keep improving my overall well-being. I’ve gotten into Buddhism.

j8a1cbr,"I mean… was it the wisest thing for her to go over there when he asked her not to? Maybe not, but depending on how long they’ve been dating, I can see how someone you love (who’s in a vulnerable psychological state) suddenly ghosting you out of the blue and breaking things off would cause OP’s reaction. Especially if his behavior is really out of character—we don’t really know if that’s the case here because those details aren’t included—but they’ve been dating for 6 months If my current long term bf did that to me when we were together that long (we are both in recovery by the way), I wouldn’t just be like, “Okay. Have a nice life,” and not feel compelled to get some closure/check on him. Calling a welfare check could have been more appropriate, but OP was not “absolutely an asshole” here. I’d say she acted the way most human beings would in this confusing, hurtful, and honestly dysfunctional situation. The therapist literally was feeding him a script to say to OP as he was breaking up with her (that’s straight insane) and excessively texts him at 10 pm at night trying to control his every move—way to help him gain some assertiveness and confidence to make boundaries…🙄And her calling the cops was ridiculous, totally overkill. It’s not the police’s job to help with relationship drama when there’s no threat of violence or illegal activity. You can’t call the cops every time you’re uncomfortable creating a boundary. And the whole “It’s not about you; it’s about his sobriety” thing doesn’t hold water. Someone’s sobriety isn’t dependent on whether other people are in their life or not. It’s independent of that and the sole responsibility of the addict. Even if OP’s an enabler, most people in relationships with addicts are, an addict’s recovery is very possible whether their partner gets help with their codependency or not. The break up is due to other issues here. OP’s wellbeing is just as important as her bf’s recovery. This IS about her. It’s HER post.",1676231435.0

Good news is you didn’t take it for very long and you weren’t taking a bunch, so it should pass. Not everyone in recovery supports this, but there’s a root called Kava Kava that is non-addictive and acts on some of the same receptors as Xanax. It’s not strong enough to quell a panic attack for me but it definitely helps with sleep and mild anxiety, so you might give it a try.

Most people don't suffer many negative side effects from suboxone, as it's only a partial opioid agonist, so doesn't fully bind to the receptors. Very early in my recovery (first 6 months or so) i was on 16mg, after getting a good foothold on recovery, i was fine at 8mg, and have been stable on doses as low as 2mg. You personally might need to be at a higher dose for a longer period of time to make sure you're not hitting post acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS) also if you're a male, you should have your hormone levels checked out, you might need testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) its a common issue for people dealing with opioid use disorders.

He told you very clearly he did not want to see you in person, and that it's not about you, it's about his sobriety. If you care about him, respect that. He has more important things to focus on and he's made that very clear. Please. Do not go over there again, do not try to contact him again. If and when he's ready to see you he will reach out. If you don't struggle with addiction this might be very hard to try to wrap your head around. It sounds like he's tried being open and gentle. His therapist called the police because she knew you weren't going to leave on your own and her patient has clearly expressed concerns over his ability to hold boundaries with a person who is unwilling to respect them. This is not about you. At all. You're not an asshole for being concerned about him. You're absolutely an asshole for disregarding his request. Please give him space.

The klons created a neural pathway in your brain that is no longer flowing with your normal dose. That pathway will naturally fill in as you progress. Your brain will start to get more reactive to smaller doses. Stay strong man. I watched a lot of new shows and played a lot of video games when I was in your spot.

There’s that saying “you can’t keep what you have unless you give it away” and I do believe that’s true. I fell into sponsorship because someone reached out to me specifically, and I helped him. That really opened my eyes and whenever someone reaches out (sponsorship or otherwise) I don’t say no anymore because it’s important. It’s important for them obviously, but it’s important for me because it helps me keep what I have by realizing my gratitude for those who helped me and helps me remember the parts of my past that my mind wants to forget. My sponsor once told me “we forget so we can remember” and I think that’s wise. I get you don’t want to do it, trust me I do, but try it and be open to it and honest with yourself about it.

Once you find a group of people you really, really like, I believe the service will come naturally. Think of people you like outside of the rooms. If they asked for help, would you help them? I assume the answer is yes! When you find people you like in the rooms and they ask for help, you will help them.",1675982215.0

When things got real bad being sober in recovery having to live with the fallout, consequences, guilt and shame of my addiction, what I’ve lost, etc. the only thing that really helped me, helped me turn all those negatives into something somewhat positive and bearable to live with was the fact that because of my circumstances I was able to help someone else. I believe that is the spirit of the 12th step. There are many, many ways in which I’m able to achieve this because of my experience and wisdom.  - I’m not into AA or step work. That has not been apart of my recovery this time. It’s worked.

j7w3f18,"I was exactly in your boat 7 years ago. I relate to everything you said. Here's what happened: I let my home group members and sponsor know that I was grateful for all the help and support they gave me. I then told them that I'm staying sober but am no longer going to be a member of AA, and that they can give me a call if they ever want to talk. I was a year sober when I made this decision. I felt that I had learned all I needed to learn and had a spiritual experience. So I left. All was well for around 4 months, and I didn't have any cravings for that period. I'm not really sure what happened, but I relapsed around 5 months after leaving the program. Those AA bastards were right. I ended up getting worse than before I went into AA. This happened a couple more times over the years. In and out of AA... I eventually sobered up and got back into the program. I decided to keep ""doing the deal"" this time and have now been sober for 3.5 years. Look.... Whether or not you need to ""do the deal"" for the rest of your life to stay sober and at peace is up to you. If you don't want to stay in AA then don't. If you slip up and realize you need to go back then do it. No one can tell you if you're the type alcoholic/addict that I am. But if you are the type that I am, and you stop working the program then you'll relapse. Again though, only you can determine this.",1675975100.0

I still have a drink here or there because I know its not a problem for me, but it sucks because NA helped keep me off the stuff i actually DID have a problem with and now I feel unwelcome because I don't agree with the ""alcohol is a drug"" part.

j7w07v4,"What I see here is a lot of all-or-nothing thinking, future-tripping, and pleasing others. Those are all pretty common alcoholic traits. Live in today. If you don’t want a scheduled and organized service position, don’t take one. It doesn’t need to be anymore complicated than that. If someone pressures you, the appropriate response is “I’m doing what’s best for my sobriety today.” And it doesn’t need to go any further than that. Anyone who is really that invested in what you’re doing probably needs Al Alon. Don’t fall victim to the thought that you have to be a fully-invested lifelong servant to the program. Service is on all levels, big and small. Showing up to meetings is service, because we need asses in chairs to have meetings. Sharing is service, because newcomers need to see how other people are maintaining long term sobriety. At the very least, even if I were to show up and sound like a total dick, SOMEONE there is benefitting from it by seeing what they don’t want to be like anymore. If you don’t want to be self centered, try to make a goal to at least donate money to AA or volunteer a few times a year. This would be a nice way to give back to the people who saved your life without feeling like you’ve become some kind of slave to them. You know what’s best for you at the end of the day. As much as the people who helped you out of your hole would prefer you stuck around to pass on that help, they helped you in the first place because they cared about you not dying.

That’s not a message you could carry and you could end up hurting people’s chances at a full recovery. After 11 months, I generally stop trying to convince people of the stuff they should be doing, they know what the suggested actions are an either they do then or they don’t. One of two realities will usually manifest. One possibility is your are not alcoholic and needed some coaching on making better decisions (and have the power to do that) and are gonna be just fine without AA (which to be honest is a pain in the ass a lot of times and not worth it if you don’t know you need to do it). The other is your are fatally selfish and ego-driven from a spiritually malady (such that you can’t even be moved to help someone get the relief that was freely given to you) that only a spiritual experience will solve and you will either die drunk or by suicide eventually or make everyone’s life around you a living hell or come crawling back into AA after a whole lot of pain. I’ve seen both a lot. In terms of what to do, let your people in AA know you aren’t clear that you want what AA has to offer, appreciate their time, and are going to step away. It’s better than ghosting and us worrying. I’ve had several friends do that and remained close with them after.",1675964430.0

I do not feel like this makes me self centered, of course I would help a friend within reason, but my priority is me and I do not feel that’s problematic. I don't completely understand where you're coming from here. Service is as simple as putting away chairs, counting cash, or making coffee. You can give back to the program without becoming the GSR or sponsoring a dozen people. I answer phones for the NYC intergroup once a week (it gets routed to my cell) and tell people where their nearest meeting is. It's low effort, low commitment, but helpful, and makes me feel like I'm doing my part. I will add that I never succeeded in getting sober (through AA, smart recovery, rehabs, etc) until I started prioritizing other people before myself -- doing service has been good for me. That might not be your story, though. Edit -- Also there's no 'leaving'. You don't give up your sobriety or your chip or whatever.

So basically what I walked away with was a toolbox and AA/NA provides the workshop. Regardless of what you decide with rehab, you definitely need to taper off the Xanax. Lookup the Ashton Manual (available free online) for a guide on how to taper safely and check out r/benzorecovery for support in quitting. I don’t have any experience with kratom but I suspect you may be able to find a sub dedicated to helping people quit it as well.

But if one goes in there and questions everything and doubts everything, it isn't going to work. It isn't going to be for you. Recovery is there to help you find the ""you"" you really want to be. It isn't a place to make robots. People have a hard time understanding this. How? Why? What? But it is true. We just sit around trying to find ourselves and help others find themselves after losing ourselves to gallons and gallons of booze and piles and piles of pills. And once we find ourselves, we are trying to learn how live in this weird world of ours. You ought to join us. These rooms are safe.

I’ve been managing other symptoms with 5-HTP, ashwagandha, magnesium, cbd, and propranolol. My experience has been: taper down, don’t feel anything at first, then get hit by a wave of withdrawals 2-4 days after the taper, which ease up over 1-2 weeks as my body adjusts to the new dose. No seizures or anything too serious - my biggest symptoms have been mood swings which include slightly increased anxiety and depression. Physically, I’ve had days that I don’t notice much of anything, and other days where I feel like I have the flu. Sore muscles, no appetite, brain fog… It depends on where I am in my taper schedule. I’ve also been dealing with a fair amount of itchiness (little zaps all around my body that I feel the need to scratch). Overall, the process has not been as grueling as I expected it to be.

In the beginning he respected my boundaries and didn't do it around me. He said it helps him to stay away from alcohol, which was a problem for him. So at first it didn't bother me. I let it slide because his drinking used to be so bad and I didn't want him to relapse. But now he literally HAS to smoke every 3 hours or so, and if he doesn't he gets really moody and irritable and takes it out on me. He does it in front of me now and invites friends over to smoke him up when he runs out. I usually leave and go for a walk or whatever because we live in a tiny apartment and it doesn't matter what room I'm in, I can still smell it. At this point he's clearly substituting one for another, all the same addictive behaviors are back, his use is stopping him from getting and keeping a job, I'm triggered all the time and the relationship as a whole is just a mess.

I also noticed my brain fog and impaired abilities to do anything(School, Chores, reading, band conversation). My concern only got worse as people literally started thinking i was retarded💀.I’m currently on a week break from smoking since 16. I was heavy into the cart age where most of the shit might’ve even been fake tbh. Making things worse here. it was on and on until i took a 3 month break and felt way better but then i got right back into it because people influenced me. We will not let weed permanently fuck us. Trust. I do my research with anything that concerns me and i’ve turned to Nootropics. The most effective nootropics for cognitive boost will help you. It is pricey to buy supplements especially more than one but it’s really worth it when your talking about the effects it can have down the line. Lions mane Duel extract 8:1 for brain function and memory. Aniracetam for conversion fluency and mood, Baccopa for confidence and action. I would recommend taking tongkat ali for testosterone boost which will make you more of a man. Honorable mention Alpha Brain by onnit which helps with overall well-being. Now you can search for different products but these specific ones i’ve mentioned are top of the line and are well known for their significant cognitive affects. Take it into consideration. It will make you feel right again. Don’t take your live for the leaf man. If you want a real euphoric experience for creativity that weed promised. try microdosing shrooms. like .25g or less. I think weed just turns you into more of an NPC but cycling it can be good too if you really like it. GOODLUCK",1675623611.0
j7c0gap,"So are you using heroin, meth, or cocaine? And is your alcoholism to the point that you will experience withdrawal? I ask this because, you're right, honesty is the first step. You need to come to terms with your problem and tell everyone in your life, as this will make it impossible to lie to yourself. The way the human mind works, if we lie about our addiction to everyone, subconsciously, we lie to ourselves as well. But after being honest, you'll need to get clean. The thing it sounds like you missed last time you get clean is counseling; I'd recommend Inpatient Treatment, followed by Outpatient Treatment 3 days a week, with individual counseling and self help meetings/activities 3 days a week for a year, followed by continued counseling and participation in self help groups/activities as needed. This sounds like a lot, but think of it this way: you have the rest if your life ahead of you, and it's better to take this time to do this thing right and give yourself as solid base so that hopefully, you never have to go through another relapse again, and if per chance you do, you will have the tools and skills to arrest it before it gets out of hand and robs you of everything.",1675619741.0

j7a2aob,"So you’ve received a lot of good advice so far in this thread. Let me offer you a little encouragement on top of that. For you to be 19 and to be able to recognize where you are with your addiction and where you want to be is absolutely amazing. Personally, I was completely clueless and hopelessly naive at your age. You’ve had a rough start in life, but you’re responding to it with a great deal of strength and wisdom. You should be very proud of yourself. I’m really glad to hear that you’re getting therapy to learn how to handle these experiences life has given you. You’re making a lot of great decisions. Try to go easy on yourself for the experience you had with those “friends.” I take away two things from that. First, you’ve got a solid moral core. You knew you didn’t want to try the things they were pressuring you to do. That’s absolutely something you can build on. Second, it sounds like you’ve learned a lot from the experience and won’t be so easily swayed by others in the future. There really only is one failure in life and that is to fail to learn from your experiences. I’ve got twenty plus years of drug addiction in my past and my history is full of a metric shit-ton of relapses. But I can look back on the past, including each of my trips to rehab, each time I stepped back into the rooms, each time I took some step to free myself, and see how I’ve made progress towards my goal over the years, sometimes painfully slowly, but progress nonetheless. Now I’m a big old stubborn knucklehead who insists on doing everything the hard way, so I don’t recommend following my path. I needed life to not just slap me upside the head but knock out a few teeth, kick me in the balls, and lay me out flat on the floor before I started getting the message. You don’t have to do that, and it sounds like you already on a better path than mine. What will it take to get to that sense of balance that you want? Time, first and foremost. Not picking up, no matter what. Doing the next right thing, especially when you don’t want to. All the old cliches. But I’d start throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. Try some guided meditation. Check out some twelve step programs. Check out some non-twelve step support groups. Try some yoga. Do some journaling. Maybe some drawing or something else creative. Exercise. Getting out into nature. Prayer, which can be either liturgical (basically reciting and repeating a prayer someone else has written, like the serenity prayer) or it can spring from your own mind. Find some way to help others. I’m sure there are lots more ideas besides these. Give ‘em all a shot. Maybe some won’t be much help but some will be. And keep coming back here and let us know how you’re doing. But seriously, excellent work so far!",1675576744.0
j7a1acm,"you're so welcome man that's what this is all about right 🙂 it's been a pretty rough week/month/year this way but i find showing the positivity truly helps others and, most of the time, helping others truly makes me happy because i have had someone send a truly simple message of positivity and reminding me that everything will be okay...and it legit made this 34 yo cry at that time because it was when i was at (well honestly one of my many) lowest points. i've been using whatever i could since 10th grade...something i have finally accepted and can work on moving forward with my life since i have admitted this to myself. i'll always be an addict...but i won't always be using drugs 🙂❤️ i really hope, and think alot of ppl do, realize how much a simple txt msg or comment saying hello and how are you doing etc can means to a other person...it did to me then as i hadnt talked to anyone in weeks, was recovering from yet another seizure, and honestly...was just sleeping as much as possible because my dreams were the only thing keeping me happy. dreaded waking up every day because atleast whilst sleeping, heck maybe i had a friend to talk to, my ex of 8 yrs could still be there, i still had my job before getting laid off. waking up, as embarrassed i am to admit it but i believe in honesty, was the worst part of my day. And it still happens sometimes...this week i was sick and the dreams were so vivid and incredible that stayed in bed all week just to try to capture a slice of that happiness i found in my dreams. lol makes me want to go listen to el dorado by ELO...it's a concept album where the main character decided to stay in his dream world because that is where he is truly happy. sorry for the essay hah but seriously i am so glad when anything i say helps a fellow person. that's why i love this community. got really do have this pal!!",1675576065.0

j789349,"That’s wild that you say that because while I am extremely self conscious about it & expecting my therapist to laugh at it I say “Inside I feel like my true self is the kid who cried all the time, just this 8,9 or 10 year old in the fetal position crying” I became a drug addict and alcoholic around age 15. I just hit 18 months and have made great strides in addiction as well as mental health but have a long way to go &I have been having trouble with employment for years even the last 18 months because while it may sound like excuses, I feel as if I am the equivalent of a weird child who has grown mentally in the ways expected mostly but not emotionally. Like I am informed on politics statistics history and things I enjoy and am pretty speculative and knowledge seeking, but emotionally? I am a 9 year old kid who is crying and if I’m not crying it’s throwing a temper tantrum bro. It’s an embarrassing analogy at least to myself especially would not like to repeat to a woman who is a Romantic interest. Not said in that way at least. I suggest posting the same or a similar post in r/MentalHealth. Both good perspectives through here and there. A lot of the people in the mental health community have addiction issues as well, as a means to escape the pain or trauma. I do not enjoy a lot of members from recovery support groups opinions on mental health. I’ve had countless times people tell me to quit my meds because I seemed fine. Yeah I am fine NOW after getting my mental health mostly straight and no longer having a reason to myself to continue using & then they both got better as they help each other grow in a positive light just how they hurt each other in a negative light. I had been to psychiatric hospitals a lot in my early 20s as I could not handle life. I think I went 6 times from age 20 to age 25. I am 28 now and have not been back in 3 years. The number one enemy of getting better from mental health also in my opinion id like to point out that mental health does get better addiction gets better if you start doing beneficial things. I feel as if that is a common problem in that everyone says “There’s no point im not going to get better anyway” I think that is true for some people in never getting better and using this phrase, but I think that is because they have been led to believe that is the only way is to just be miserable because their not going to get better. Idk how I think about it for myself. To summarize I feel as if sometimes people do not have the capacity to make their lives better as they have been conditioned to believe that there is no getting better. Anyway good on ya for getting into recovery. It’s especially unstable at first I would say too, usually for me it was the first 3-5days and then at 27-30days and then coming up on any recognized increment of sobriety up until me personally losing any desire all of it even if it was just a little at about 5 months",1675544130.0

j77pp32,"Hahaha, I feel you. When I got off of heroin, I did stay away from anything mind altering for about two years. I also worked as a drug and alcohol counselor during that time.

Then I left counseling, I realized it definitely wasn't for me - and moved into a job in harm reduction where all my thoughts and ideas about recovery were chewed up and shit out. You get to do what works for you. For some people, that means total abstinence from all substances. For some, that means staying away from blues or heroin and not necessarily alcohol and weed. In my case, it means stay away from heroin. Probably won't use any amphetamines either.

j77kz3l,"Hey, venting is good. Sometimes ya just gotta get shit off your chest, so totally understandable! 1- Congrats on 90+ days! I am at 88 days since my last relapse so I’m just right behind you. You’re doing great so far, considering you’re getting past 30-60 days 👏🏼 2- as I’m sure you’ve heard, AA/NA/12-step programs aren’t for everyone, & that’s okay, & that doesn’t mean there aren’t other things that can help you in your recovery just as efficiently. I’ve been hiding from NA for several reasons, but actually really enjoyed it, & I know none of my excuses really justify my avoidance. If AA really helps you, I’d say the same thing NA members have told me- just talk to your sponsor (or someone you know from group) & they will understand more than you know. But if AA really doesn’t help you, you don’t have to be in AA (unless you are court ordered). There is no clear path to recovery, there is no right or wrong way to recover other than just to recover, which happens in a variety of ways for each person. 3- I totally get that frustration of wanting this part to just hurry up & skip ahead. Especially when it feels like it’s been forever already & you’ve put in so much effort. Something really important in recovery is practicing acceptance. Whether where you are right now is fair or not, you have to accept the right now as it is. Where you are right now is not where you will be forever, & your past is not a reflection of your future. You don’t have to be happy with how things are going, but just try coming to terms with how it is going for right now, bc again, it’s not going to go like this always. A monk (don’t remember name) once said when you learn how to suffer, you suffer much less. When you refuse to come to accept something for what it is (something happening, your feelings, etc), you get stuck, you turn your pain into suffering, & you are unable to move forward from it until you learn to accept it. When you accept it, your pain is still there, but only temporarily, & it begins to heal & get easier to get past. But remember that healing & moving forward also takes longer than we like it to, but we have to accept the duration of the process too. 4- most things in life we have no control over, & truthfully there’s no point in stressing about things out of our control bc stressing about it does nothing but put us in a negative state, which affects how we do things we do have control of. The best advice a professor of mine has ever given me is, when you are stressing about things outside of your control (how long the process is, aspects of this case, etc), try writing down the things you do have control of, & then ask yourself what you can do to put in your best effort towards those things. Things like staying sober, taking care of yourself, taking care of your dog, exercise & diet, the boundaries you set, how you talk to yourself, etc. Working on those things won’t rid you of all problems, but it will give you a sense of control in life, & it can help even things outside your control go over much easier. Good luck :)",1675534062.0
j77hxgt,"Alcohol and drug addiction kind of freeze us to the age we were when we became addicted. Not intellectually so much as emotionally. We stop coping and growing when we find that thing that originally helped ease our pain and rely solely on the substance. So in a very true way you are still a child. Avoiding pain also dulls /kills the myriad other feelings that cause us to grow and move on. Once you see this in yourself and others you'll never unsee it. One day at a time but start now rather than later. The average age of recovery groups is getting younger for a lot of reasons so you'll be in good company.

j7764a5,"I’m gonna be really honest with you. It’s worth noting first and foremost that millions of people come off benzos every year and are fine, however A lot of benzo withdrawal is mental. When you use benzos for long periods you affect the receptors that regulate how we deal with stress and how we sleep, your GABA receptors. This affects everyone differently… it’s going to have the opposite effects to why you started taking it to begin with. My sleep and stress were heavily affected. I also abused drugs for 9 years and detoxed off 6 different substances all were depressants which Makes sense why I had trouble sleeping. Benzos have been the hardest to stop and I’m still tapering, 18 months later..I only need 6-10mg Valium now, I also take mirtAzipine and propanolol and smoke weed. A lot of people are probably not gonna consider that sober, but it’s a long way from where I was at. I’ve also relapsed multiple times since starting this journey which hasn’t helped. But you can’t live needing Xanax to sleep forever cause benzos don’t work forever. These drugs are not for long term use and once you switch to Valium you will find your sleeping pattern eventually. My advice would be to focus on routine, focus on your kid. Do not focus on other peoples horror stories that will get you nowhere at all. It’s a mental game so don’t give yourself negative mental ammunition where possible and what I mean by that is reading other peoples symptoms. Also under no circumstances cold turkey off of benzos, that’s a sure way to get you nowhere. Just take each day as it comes and try and taper as slowly as possible and everything will work out. You will feel more confident with a plan. Don’t be ashamed to speak to family, it doesn’t seems like you’re an addict, anybody taking any substance for long periods is gonna cause some discomfort when the come off.

j76hf9y,"I don’t have the answers because my addiction is different with prescription painkillers. But I can tell you that nicotine is one of the major reasons that you feel those urges. When certain neurons fire together, they wire together. So if you’re using a narcotic substance while also using nicotine which is a highly addictive substance, then those neurons fire together. It’s the reason why a lot of people can’t help but smoke cigs or vape when they drink. It’s also been shown that over 90% of people who become addicted to opioids were smokers prior to getting their prescription. The people who don’t smoke cigarettes were able to quit the painkillers after the pills ran out in the vast majority of cases while the smokers couldn’t. I have found that when I tried to quit smoking and pain pills at the same time, my urges for nicotine vastly overpowered my urges for drugs. And you can quit nicotine in like a week. So I can recommend quitting smoking. Whether you think that’s possible or not, you should also seek out narcotics anonymous or alcoholics anonymous. The book and stepwork is actually magical if you can get behind it, but that’s a secondary piece. The main reason you should go is just to meet a sponsor and a support group of sober people who can guide you. They all have been through this and successfully got themselves and others through it before. So whether you like their methods or not , you will be shown a path that works. And you will suddenly have people to talk to and lean on. Go there and meet some people and you’ll do a lot better. Even if you don’t want to do the steps, you need to at least get to know some people who won’t lead you astray. You’ll make new friends who will have your best interest in mind.",1675516694.0

If that means welfare, take it. The first year of sobriety, it's a roller coaster. You're not used to anniversaries and birthdays and holidays being good things, but something you had to get annihilated to avoid the emotions around. You're going to be okay. One day at a time, one minute at a time, one choice at a time. One foot in front of the other. Start a hobby. Find something that gives you mental relief, and small accomplishable goals, to build your self-esteem. I don't care if it's writing, woodworking, crochet, knitting, running. Anything, that helps you sit with self. Don't expect overnight miracles from therapy or sobriety, they help, but it's not something you just unlock, like a video game. Time is what makes the most difference. Perspective, constantly growing, and not beating yourself up for small setbacks. Start a journal, and don't read what you write for 3 months, and then read it. You'll see what I mean. The hardest part about sobriety at your age is FOMO. But if I could honestly undo a lot of stuff that happened at that age, if I did not have to experience the violence and the losses, whooo. Start making bigger plans for yourself, do what you want to do. If that's college, if that's a family, whatever. Keep a goal in mind, and remind yourself that it's not fair that you've already had this much life experience, but that you're prepared more than some of your peers. It truly is a gift.

I saw members as AA book-thumpers or unintelligent street level people, either way they weren’t like ME. Those were my true feelings and at the time I needed to have them. Today, I can look back and think, wow you were such a bitch. My perspectives on life, people, and my addiction has evolved and changed and I can honestly say AA has helped me becoming a more loving, kind, and tolerant person. I still judge, I’m not an f’ing saint, i take what I need and leave the rest on the cutting room floor. I hope you can find meetings that help you. They’re out there :)",1675348186.0

One script of trulicity is over $1000 with a GoodRX discount. My son is my only reason. My daughter turns 18 in March and she never texts or calls and she doesn't respond when I text. I've seen her one time in the last 16 months and only a few times in the 3 years. So it's all ab my son rn. He's all I have. I want to be there for him but this detox is probably going to ruin that for me. I texted his mother and asked if she could take him for 3-4 weeks and I told her I could help feed him and give him some cash but she texted back ""No data rn"" idk what that has to do with anything. All of this is just a part of the reason why I'm so afraid of inpatient detox. I'm afraid the SSRI won't help my anxiety bc they didn't help my depression. I'm afraid my ex will try to get custody of my son and I just put in an application to move a couple months ago and I'm afraid I will be in detox when an apartment becomes open and I will lose my home and everything in it.

That's a pretty good description of someone struggling with addiction. You don't need to be blacking out every night or shooting heroin under a bridge or check any other shame boxes to need help with addiction. Might want to give NA shot. In NA, they don't distinguish between drugs and consider alcohol a drug, which IMHO it is. No one is sure about ""life long abstinence"" when they start. That's why it's so hard to stay clean/sober.

j6udbu0,"Other than Xanax, are you only taking Seroquel? This is an anti-psychotic medication, yes? You may need to take an anti-depressant/anti-anxiety medication to help with your anxiety (and seems you have some depression re suicidal thoughts). My grandma was on Xanax for over 20 years, though she was prescribed I think it was 1mg tablets and would take half in the morning then at night, she was very responsible with it and does suffer from very bad anxiety. The Drs made her get off it in 2021 as in Australia they have pretty much banned Xanax, it is very hard to get. I thought this was ridiculous in my grandma's case as she is in her 70s and clearly never abused the drug, I don't see why they couldn't of let her live out her life as she was. Though she did eventually wean off of it, it took close to a year as she did it very slowly. They also prescribed her Vallium afterwards for whenever she needs it (panic attacks). It wasn't easy for her but she did it. She also takes anti-depressants which I think help her. As you may know, sometimes it is needed as we have a chemical imbalance in the brain (my opinion). I take Aropax 10mg a day for my anxiety, I was on 20mg of another, though when I switched to Aropax (due to side effects of no libido) I started on 15mg of Aropax as Dr suggested due to this anti-depressant 'being stronger' and a month or 2 ago I tapered down to 10mg (was annoying for me having to halve a tablet every day, and thought I'd just try it out to see how I felt, which is okay.)

You don’t have to stop. If you can see your life has become unmanageable due to substance abuse, AA is for you. Just go to some ID meetings & let it all wash over you again. You don’t have to identify. I can’t believe I remembered all the AA slogans I wrote above - it’s been over 15yrs. I’m also a poly substance abuser but AA gave me solid support in the beginning & helped me understand that I wasn’t alone & no one chooses to be an addict. We self medicate bc it works but then it turns on us & it looks like it’s turned on you again. What you went through growing up was dreadful. There’s nothing worse than being ostracised by friends & peers but you survived while many teens don’t. You’re a survivor. You’re not a victim anymore. You’re still young with a very bright future so grab it bc you deserve it. Find a Psychiatrist that specialises in addiction recovery.

j6st459,"AA isn't always easy. My newest sponsee was calling repeatedly last night on a phone with a bad connection, could barely make out his complaints with his boss at the job he was able to land sober. The horrible boss suspended him from work for 3 days for screwing up and stopping the major plant assembly line. I had things to do, but eventually got across the idea that making amends to the horrible boss when he was allowed to return was in the sponsee's interest. Was later having some fun with the wife and took other calls from a lonely guy who's wife was away on vaca, leaving him alone and feeling so lonely. Talked about getting together at our next mutual meeting on Fri. I do believe one reason AA's worked well for me for a long time is that it inconveniences me and I wind up doing things I don't care to do for people who are trying and demanding. You could similarly be helping some old guy with a lot of time stay sober by bothering him repeatedly with your various complaints about AA, the people there, your lack of a job, the court thing, your missing counselor, the volunteering hours, how your trust was violated, and the general state of your life. The help you'd give him and the help he'd give you as your sponsor is a two way street that cancels out the need to feel any obligation or appreciation to him. Different than when people were trying to help us out of generosity, duty or pity. Yours for the asking.

I’m still never asked “are you ok?” even when I’m still crying over the best friend (my dog) that passed 3 months ago. It’s not their fault that they don’t have the ability to empathise. I believe addiction is a lonely disease. We are born seeking something outside of ourselves to take away our feelings of distress. Medication can definitely help though I’m not a fan of SSRI’s & SNRI’s. To me, they didn’t work & were harder to taper off than Suboxone which did work. I think you’re going to do very well.

Being an addict you will replace drink with absolutely anything, sure maybe treat yourself in the short term but be wary if you find yourself getting habitual with anything. The addictive tendency has to be recognised and managed (with help) I would advise you to get some support, be it councillors or support groups. I’d highly recommend doing CBT and understand what makes you want to escape through drinking. Learn to love yourself so that you can be loving to those around you and lead a fulfilling life. Deal with the issues. Getting clean and staying off your drug of choice is just the start. We have to understand why we feel the need to use and deal with the issue at the root of the situation.

j6ldr1c,I did the same thing like almost exactly except it was a birthday party for a friend and i dont remember bashing my head but i know i did because of how my forehead looked lmaooo. And exactly like you i used it as my rock bottom and got sober but the fact hes willing to try working it out with you means he cares so much and you have to use your actions to speak for you and stay sober and start recovery like every one else is taking about. What helped for me was allowing myself to over indulge or go nuts on any other consumable that wasnt liquor or anything worse. Like coffee or gummies or anything you are ok with consuming lol. Buy fancy coffee and cheap stuff so you can treat yourself like your used to and can just go nuts if you feel the need. Nows the time to grab on to anything that will let you and use it to get you thru the beginning and every day it really will get easier. Even if it feels like it aint it is. Try and think of things like good chemical givers. For me its gummies clothes any kind of candy also coffee and workout powders. It feels like so much money but if i didnt even really hesitate buying 50-60 dollar bottles why shouldnt i buy this work out powder to have a tasty drink with vitamins in it to help me out?

Second, keep reminding yourself how good you feel about yourself and how well you treat others when you are not drinking or using any other substance. That is the order you need to remember- how you feel good about yourself and then how good you treat others when you are not drinking. Make a mental tape of those feelings. Any time you feel like using, play that tape again in your head. Third, if necessary, play the tape of how things get out of control when you drink. When you are tempted to use, first play the “good” mental tape over and over. Only if you are still tempted, play the “bad” tape over in your mind. Now, this is the hard part - you have to do the homework - what is causing you to abuse alcohol and/or other drugs? It might be that you are self-medicating because of something in your life that isn’t going well. Perhaps, something bad that happened previously. To help with this, find an experienced counselor with whom you can relate. Be open with that person. Not sure if you are in the US, but if so, alcohol isn’t too easily available so is someone supplying you with it? If so, can you avoid that person?

If you were married to a person for 15 years--it had been a lot of fun in the early years but, over time, things steadily declined and you were ultimately miserable in the relationship. You and your spouse eventually divorce--you might share with others some of the things you did that helped you get through the rough days, you might try to encourage a friend who tells you she's struggling in their own marriage, and might even try to help them leave the relationship-even if that's just providing support and resources; Empathizing and commiserating It's not that it has an inescapable grip over you for the entirety of your life no matter what--but it's always going to be a part of you. whether you still identify as alcoholic/addict or not doesn't change anything about your past, so you might as well share with others the things that did or didn't work for you. Talking about a huge part of your life with others in a similar position is no indicator of the power that thing may have over that individual.

I was prescribed 12mg a day. It was a living nightmare. Xanax is intense. It is one of 3 drugs I know of that you can die widthdrawing from. You can have seizures, psychotic breaks, and many more issues coming off. There was NO WAY I could have done it on my own. I checked myself into a facility that was dual diagnosis. They provided me a psych who helped provide other meds that toned down my anxiety. I will be real with you, it takes a while to get off the stuff. I was a mess for about 3 weeks. I had cold towels on the back of my neck, I was showering 3 times a day because it was one of the few comforts, I was drinking tons of water and never peeing because my anxiety was so high I couldn't even stand in a bathroom comfortably. But the main thing is that it DOES get better. Xanax is a fast reacting, fast dissipating drug. And the come down is intense to say the least. It will be one of the hardest things you ever do in life, but get off the stuff now. Talk about sleeping problems. Get a sleep med from the psych. But I would highly suggest, you go into treatment. What is 30 days to give you the rest of your life? It is totally worth it. It won't be easy. But man, it will change your life. Go all in and better your life today before it shatters tomorrow.",1674975489.0
j6b05zj,"Hi I’m a recovering meth addict. I know exactly what you mean, it felt like meth hurt my soul. It definitely changed me while I was using (I’ve been addicted and using off on and on for the last six years). It’s definitely taken a huge toll on my life in many ways. The cravings are awful, thats what always gets me. The euphoric recall is so intense it overwhelms common sense for a little. Anyway good look! I hope you can stop ASAP. You already know this is no good for your life, it’s a drug that doesn’t mix well with you.

I don't know how it is in the UK at the moment, but Fentanyl is making into other drugs here in the US. Including coke and meth. Thats scary shit, not just the overdose potential, but greater addiction potential as well. Not to mention taking a legal/law enforcement risk every time you go to score. Another thing to consider, you might actually have a mental health issue that could be helped with prescribed medication while under the care of a medical professional. Using will make figuring out something like that impossible. The first step always seems hard, i know you can do it.

You just need more rest than it's possible to get while using daily. My counselor/therapist had a phrase that really helped me stay positive and in active recovery, going on 15 years now from opioid use disorder, she would say ""play the tape to its conclusion"" to remind yourself where things end up when you use daily. Relapses happen, they are sometimes part of the recovery process. Try to limit the duration as much as you can. The withdrawal symptoms will be easier to deal with if you are able to limit the length of the relapse. Reach out to someone you care about, that also cares about you. Let them know what's going on, tell them you need support. If you have access to counseling services, reach out to a counselor specializing in addiction treatment.

j5x0dk8,"See a psychiatrist & explain your situation. There are medications that can help. They won't fix it all though. Im going on 4 mo clean, from suboxone & meth. I was on subs for the last 10yrs & meth for the last 5. Was forced to jump off 16mg & put the pipe down at the same damn time. I have the same symptoms as you. I also struggle with extreme anxiety. The dysphoria is a fucking bitch. For me music & emotion are the only 2 things that can penetrate. I'm prescribed 1 med for depp/anxiety & 1 for restless legs, neither of them are addictive nor antidepressants. I plan to drop those 2 as soon as my brain heals & i feel comfortable doing so. I also have cyclothymic disorder, the med for that i will be on for life -which is fine its been a life saver. Point is, for ME, those 3 meds are what has kept me from going back on subs. They do not replace the subs, this is key.. they just ease the transition. Im not exactly stoked about the fact that i still have to rely on medications but it sure beats the hell out of returning to subs. I am totally stoked to be off those god forsaken subs though. They saved my life but eventually they were only holding me back. I loved them too much, impossible for me to taper off of. But overtime they just didn't work like they used to (10yrs duh!), so my brain being corrupted by addict logic, decided to supplement with meth. Talk to a doc, cuz im not 1. And by doc I mean psychiatrist, big diff. Also don't let that 6mo number scare you. I also wouldn't go as far to say as ""it gets better/easier everyday""..thats a bit misleading & gets ppls hopes up. Its more like, you get stronger every week. But that's just me, an educated idiot. Yes you will be happier on subs.. for the first week or so. But after that, its right back in the same rut you were in to begin with but only deeper. Sober time down the drain. Plus you'll have potentially set yourself up psychologically for a slightly more difficult experience the next time you try quitting. I think this is goes without saying tho, if it comes down to you either relapsing on illicit opioids/opiates..or suboxone..obviously choose the latter. Harm prevention is paramount, there's no shame in taking the help you need. i don't mean to throw any shade at the sub patients on here btw, plz don't take it that way. im just being blunt.",1674703662.0

You already have a substance use disorder, you are exhibiting totally obvious addiction behaviors. You are in more trouble than you know. True, you don't have to ride the garbage truck all the way to the dump. But, get this. If you have never understood anything else in your life, get this concept: People that do not have serious addiction issues concerning more or less any substance or mind altering chemical,  Never, Never, have to go through all this mental masterbation as to quitting, how many days, oh no, i used again, considering whether and willingness to go to treatment. The thought of all this never occurs to the average non-addicted person. Everyone in the world is happy including your entire family, baring perhaps an ex or two, that you have not suffered the addiction ringer as have rest of us. But, given your statement above, it is never too early to seek help. It's akin to dancing on the edge of the meat grinder while reminding oneself that it's not too bad. Pardon the humor in the face of tragedy and the sarcasm. It often helps to make an impression.

j5rdyv9,"I understand and empathize as I had a similar experience when I cold turkeyed off of Ativan. It was a little odd because I was only taking it for about a week prior to stopping, granted I was taking about 12mg/day. I was self-medicating after an extremely tragic and traumatic event happened in my life on top of suffering from severe physical and mental illness. Didn’t sleep for 6 days and ended up in psychosis and suicidal. It was insane, and I have PTSD from it. Good times 🙄…Anyways, I just want to remind you that tapering is NOT going to affect you the same way going CT did. I went to inpatient detox for a week or so and they put me on Valium. It was very, very smooth for me. Nothing, NOTHING like CT. With you being on Xanax for years, you’re probably going to have a little breakthrough anxiety on a taper, which is why I’d ask if there’s any way you can do inpatient. There’s all kind of financial help for this. I just say that because it may be hard to not take more Xanax than what the taper instructions recommend due to the breakthrough.

j5qa0ou,"I took up running at the start of 2019 shortly after quitting drinking. I also quit smoking cigarettes, which I wasn't even trying to do initially, but I had never run before and wanted to finish the year with a particular race, which meant I had to be really strict about my training if I was going to complete my goal. For me, having a big challenge that didn't allow me any wiggle room was what I needed to stay on track, and provided me with an alternate source of dopamine/endorphins while my body was still sorting itself out. Regular, consistent exercise also helps to regulate your sleep cycle, which can be a big problem for a lot of people in early recovery. I recommend starting gently but very frequently in order to keep yourself busy enough that you don't find yourself with time to fill (which is when we tend to get ourselves in trouble).

j5pwqeo,"I'm a counselor who works at a combined treatment/sober living facility. When clients arrive, they sign a lot of documents, including one having to do with medication policies, which are based on our state's licensing guidelines. Without that signature, you will not be admitted to the program. Our policy is to keep all medications locked up, with the exception of rescue inhalers. Everything else is administered by staff, including tums, ibuprofen, and vitamins. All prescription medications are administered based on the doctor's instructions printed on the label and we are required to keep strict dispensing records. We get into a lot of trouble if our counts are off. Part of this has to do with liability and part of it has to do with ensuring the safety of all residents, by keeping drama to a minimum and not creating a situation where people are triggered by others keeping medication bottles with their personal belongings. It also helps to teach residents responsibility and accountability when it comes to taking their medications. That said, they should not deny medications because the timing is inconvenient to them. While techs obviously can't prescribe and they can't override the doctor's instructions, it is legal for techs to dispense meds, but they aren't allowed to actually touch them. When you get your meds, they should either watch you take the pill from the bottle or they should pour it into the cap or a little cup before handing it to you.",1674587647.0
j5oxctw,"New here so apologies if anything said below is not allowed or anything, just wanted to help out if I could! If you’re specifically interested in medication assisted treatment like methadone or suboxone then there are definitely options, it just depends on your location. In my state, our methadone clinic is covered 100% by most insurances and even if for whatever reason it’s not covered they are usually very easy to work with. At one point I paid like $5 a week because I told them it’s all I could do and that was their offer not mine. You can reach out to your insurance, there’s usually a website or number for behavioral/mental health and substance abuse, and they could help you find a place or look up local clinics on your own and check out their websites or call and find out what the process is for new patients “because you (or a friend) is interested”. Depending on if they take appointments you can make one, but most regular clinics do have walk in options. If it is a walk in and anything like my state, once you know the location then you can literally just go in and walk up to the desk and tell them you’re here because you want to talk to someone about starting treatment. They should guide you from there. There will likely be paperwork or they will ask you for insurance information or go over payment out of pocket - if they don’t then just don’t forget to ask them and make sure you know what the deal is up front! Some places are more private like doctors offices with physicians who can prescribe suboxone, but from my experience most methadone clinics are a little more open with people going in and out more “casually”. You check in and walk up to a medicating window (ours are like tiny rooms each with their own door, left open, and a walk up window where the medication is dispensed by a nurse. Almost like a ticket counters or something, lol), get your medication, leave, go home, do it again tomorrow. As far as the benzo thing - Inability to get controlled substances medications legitimately was a huge concern of mine in the past because I had been medicated for ADHD and anxiety but had stopped seeing doctors and getting them long before I entered treatment. Honestly it really depends on the place you go and the doctors there. It hasn’t seemed to be a problem here as long as you’re doing the right thing, though. I went back into therapy after many years clean on MAT and am prescribed stimulant medications for my ADHD with no issues or judgement from either the clinic or my mental health providers - but that is not the case everywhere else so keep that in mind. I also knew people at the clinic who were prescribed benzos elsewhere without problems. I had a small Valium prescription from my dentist at one point for anxiety during dental work, and in the past, prior to being on methadone, saw a doctor and psych who worked out of the same office and he prescribed me suboxone while she prescribed my anxiety and ADHD medications. Also, and I don’t think this is medical advice and is therefore safe for me to say, but just make sure you’re transparent with your doctors so they can help keep you safe from any dangerous interactions and side effects of the medication combos! I hope this was helpful, and if it wasn’t then at least I now have a “how to start medicated assisted opiate treatment” guide to bookmark for later use, haha. Feel free to reach out with any questions. Best of luck, OP. TL;DR in my state methadone programs are free with insurance. just walk in and tell them you want to start treatment and that you have insurance and they should guide you from there. i have gotten benzos prescribed despite being in recovery (legit reasons) but it’s dependent on the doctors, some are against it and others aren’t.

j5fzuk5,"I think the people who do genuinely need a meeting/multiple a day to stay clean are probably the ones who are pushing that. And some people do need that and it truly does work for them. But what works for other people you may hear less of because you’re not seeing them in the rooms as often. I would try to see if there are other people with time that you hear in the meetings, maybe who you see less often, who have stuff that resonates with you and connect with them because they’re doing something different but also making it work. If a meeting seems pretty one-minded and toxic to you, you may want to consider attending a different meeting. There absolutely are toxic meetings. I’ve heard of ones where people were “suggested” to get off all psych meds or medication assistance and they ended up killing themselves because of underlying mental illness or overdosing. Meetings vary wildly from meeting to meeting and while almost every one has “that guy” who everyone rolls their eyes at, there are ones with vibes that will nurture you and what you need to recover. There are also different fellowships if you’re getting a consistent overall vibe. One thing I’ve heard that helps me is “take the best and leave the rest,” and to go in with an open mind. I can be pleasantly surprised by people I think I can’t stand, and if I had ruled them out carte blanche I never would have heard that pearl of wisdom. How are you liking IFS?

Figure out what's really going on...I don't know where you are in the steps, but the resentment analysis process you go through in the 4th/5th steps could be very useful here. For both of you, but for her.... What's she really afraid of? It's not of you relapsing and hurting her, that's an externalization. It's probably something closer to her own fear of abandonment or being alone. Who knows...(if I were a betting woman I'd bet your gf grew up with a parent who struggled/s with substance abuse--you are not the root of that level of codependency) To get back to your question, we can regain the trust but it's a complex and layered process, and there has to be meaningful change, but not just from you: She's got to do that work as well or she'll never get away from this anxious place. And I know from experience and have seen time and again in the rooms: sometimes, as we grow in our recovery, we grow away from the things from ""the before time"". I don't know how long you've been together. I don't know if she knew you before things took a turn towards your ""rock bottom"". I don't know if she's ever known you sober. I do know that if she doesn’t change, if she doesn’t grow, you two will grow apart-trust or not, it won't matter. She's effectively setting herself up to make you choose between her and your recovery. As much as I hate this word now, if she becomes toxic to your sobriety you will either peace out because sobriety is more important than a girlfriend, or you relapse--this is the toxicity... The gremlin feeds on nasty feelings--it's already planting the seed that ""if [you] drink it was because she harped on about it being an eventuality for which she is preparing to save you both""; or just that it was an eventuality. Either way, nip it in the bud now or reap what you sow. Communicate your feelings, ask her how you can help her to be more supportive of your recovery (which could also include asking her to ""butt out"" entirely, but maybe she doesn't need to know when your struggling and talk to sponsor/program friends, or friends you can open up to, or, on the flip of that coin maybe she would benefit from joining you at an open meeting. Recovery is a process. Some would argue a lifelong process. You want someone who wants to walk along side you in that journey. Not to weigh you down or to help steer you backwards.

It sucks to have your partner treat it like a possibility but she probably just wants to help you. It's not distrusting you to fear relapse, it's just knowing the reality of the situation.

The only way trust is built is with actions, so you’re only got to show her you're trustworthy by being trustworthy. This isn’t something that happens quickly, it takes time. You’ve got to successfully navigate enough situations where relapse is a possibility and then not relapse. You have to prove you could have relapsed and didn’t. It would also benefit her to seek out some trauma counseling/therapy. It causes a physiological reaction in those around addicts when they suspect a relapse might happen.

j5a7bme,"I absolutely understand and get so annoyed with that insane pressure. One meeting I go to has people who say “don’t do 90 in 90, do 180 in 90!” Someone with almost two years was bragging that they’d been to 9 meetings in the last 5 days. What you don’t see at the meetings are all the people with lots of clean time who that approach doesn’t work for. Just because they aren’t there doesn’t mean it doesn’t work. When I was out of balance trying to make everything work early on, I had people tell me to make not one meeting a day but two—or even 3!—when I was working full time and taking a bus everywhere. I would leave at 7 am to get to work, be out until like 8 or 9 pm and have to do it all over again. I had been feeling super burned out and they kept piling on more and more expectations and demands. I’m sure those people meant well. You can stay clean a few weeks by being super busy and rushing from place to place, but I feel very convicted that most people will not be healthy doing that long term—if not from relapse then from stress. It’s very common advice, and I really think it’s bad advice for all but a very small number of people. I know of maybe one person whose recovery has been helped by trying to cram even more into their busy schedule. Additional meetings may help to a point. Remember, “easy does it.” Small, incremental changes are almost always how lasting change sticks for people. I think doing the things that “get you connected” — getting a sponsor, working the steps with them, asking for numbers/talking after the meeting, seeing what other meetings the people I like go to, and for me reaching out to see how those people answered specific questions when working the steps has been a lot of help for me. Doing the recovery version of crash dieting never did. Hang in there and it’s so cool you’re talking on here! I think getting and giving advice on recovery fora is really healthy. You will inevitably see / hear something you disagree with. Nobody speaks for all of recovery and there are many pathways to recover. What is sufficient for one person is not necessary for everyone. Taking suggestions help, but I would say try them on slowly and see if they genuinely help you.",1674312903.0
j59hbst,"After compiling my lists & sharing them with a sponsor I was then asked to pray for those people. I was extremely reluctant but my sponsor said ... how long do YOU want to be in pain? I didn't. I was exhausted from it all. So I prayed for them to be given health, happiness & prosperity- everything I would want for myself & more. For resentment, fear, worry & care or any negative emotion to be removed from me. It wasn't easy but it worked. They no longer live rent free in my head but if they do come back I do it again every day until it leaves. I now do it about every situation in my life. Forgiveness is for me to be free. It gave me the strength to seek medical help through trauma therapy (50 something sessions to learn what most people didnt have taken away) & medication. When we grow up in certain environments we arent taught to have boundaries, the opposite actually, but as an adult Im never forced to seek validation from, have or keep anyone in my life that causes me harm unless it's the other parent of my children.

j58c7dy,"Working on 11 years off heroin here, I tried multiple times, 3 halfway houses many more detox stays, nothing ever stuck. I was going to 12 step meetings and focusing on recovery but it didn’t work. Until one day I decided I was just going to start living my own life, not living any way that people in ‘recovery’ wanted me to live. I’m still 100% clean and sober I didn’t go California sober or anything, but I realized that for me, focusing on all the bad shit of the past and talking non stop about addiction wasn’t letting me move past it. I’m still an addict I have no doubt that one would set me over the edge, but I went to college, got a degree, got a career instead of a job, got married and bought a house! All things I never thought I’d do before and it took me taking responsibility for my life. I don’t attend meetings regularly these days, I do hit them up occasionally, it can be nice to go to even though I don’t have any cravings and haven’t in years. My way isn’t everyone’s way, I’m not a 12 step preacher but I see the great things it does for people. If it helps, amazing! I love it and encourage others to go, but if it doesn’t, that’s okay too. There’s ways to stay clean without 12 steps - and I hate that there are many who will condemn you to relapse if you don’t do things their way and attend group ‘xyz’ Point is, it takes work to find out what ‘it’ is for you, for me it was staying in a halfway house 9 months instead of 90 days, focusing on more than recovery and people in recovery and living for myself and meeting my expectations, nobody else’s.

j576hm3,"I’ve faced a similar issue, my therapist gave me some insightful advice that may help you. When talking through a traumatic experience, your mind & body remembers every tiny detail, which creates the reliving feeling. When you relive your trauma, it makes that wound feel fresh & recent again, which can make healing from it even more difficult. But this can also happen from even simply writing out your trauma as well. Writing or talking through trauma can be very helpful in healing for some, but not all. If you feel you’re unable to delve deep into all aspects of your life while you were using bc it feels like pouring gas into a fire that is already burning you, take that into consideration as part of your healing & recovery journey. Don’t delve too deep if it will do more harm than good. Talk what you are able to talk about. Do what you are able to do. Find the lessons you have learned from it. And be patient with yourself, you’re not expected to tackle this perfectly head on with no emotional difficulty, especially when trauma is involved. But over time, re-evaluating your past little by little at a time(!!), you will continue to make more & more progress. You don’t have to be ready to go into everything all at once.",1674250971.0

On one hand I feel like they want to say these drugs are the biggest epidemic we're dealing with and they want all the money and all the people to be for them and working for them they want all the money to do the work with and all the people to put to work. Being in recovery meeting the people I have and seeing the people succeed and fail in recovery has shown me that recovery is the answer. It isn't a magic bullet. And it isn't like a light switch but this problem was not created like a light switch. You can't just flip it on and off. It takes hard work to rebuild things it takes nothing to destroy them. We have been being destroyed. It takes nothing to destroy things no time at all think about kicking a sandcastle over. Now think about building a sand castle I'm done and over it. I want to protest.

I am not sure if you used like I did but by the I went to my final treatment and made an NA meeting I was in critical condition. Meaning, if I kept using I very soon would be dead or locked up. I needed the life saving message. I needed the FRONT row, not the back of the meeting. I was dying... I was spiritually dead. I did not now how I would live life without the drugs, I was broken to the core. I had a little help and could not even work for a month or two, I was crippled.

I was so desperate for something I would have done anything to stay clean. But also, Meetings alone did not cut it for me. I got a sponsor and followed the direction of that sponsor. I got a book, and then other books. The books were there at 3 in the morning when no one else was. I also wrote/ still write on steps. It sounds like some people on here have resentments or expectations about the meetings, I am very fortunate to have a really great area NA with a power message of Recovery. With that being said, this is Narcotics Anonymous were talking about. It's not treatment and it is not Church.

Almost everyone will come around eventually. Congratulations by the way. This is definitely a negative piece of the whole picture but the whole picture is good.

The cheating isn’t the issue- you are in a relationship with someone who is very very sick, and until he wants help, he will continue to use. The best you can do for him is not enable him- he can’t stay with you, you can’t give him money, and he needs to go to rehab and therapy before you will consider being with him again. I know it sucks, but if you stop enabling him, you could actually save his life. He has to feel more pain than pleasure to change and if he knows you’ll always be there, he will never hit rock bottom. Again, I’m very sorry.

What became apparent with time for me was: the best way for the guilt and regret to start to lose its sting was through becoming reliable, dependable, and available for those who cared for me. Given time, the continued act of being available, for advice, for help, for whatever, gave me back (slowly, over time) some self respect. I started to accept I was more this person (the reliable one) than the me lost in addiction. It doesn't remove the despair and regret, but those lose their potency. Keep going, doing what you're doing. People will start to trust with continued demonstrations. Loved ones will begin to lean on you again, friends will seek advice, you'll be able to provide acts of service, and that will give you back some belief in yourself that overrides the narrative of self loathing we all got caught in as our addictions took over. It seems like a mountain to climb when you're closer to the sharp end of things, but it's absolutely not - be consistent, and keep trying to do the right thing - over time others will notice and start to trust that _this_ you is the real you. You'll start to believe it too, and the shame will start to lose power. Wishing you all the best, it's a journey that will leave you a stronger, better person than you were even pre addiction.",1674149604.0

j50uvdn,He will lose it if he continues this way. He doesn’t know it bc when ur an addict you don’t really think about the consequences you it sounds like he’s just using now not to be sick. My suggestion is have an intervention asap with ultimatums. You need to prepare yourself get his family together and try to find him and plead him to go into rehab or else you leave and the family will have to deny him a place to stay…he needs an ultimatum or else he is gunna continue to abuse you all which is not his intention but it is happening bc he is sick. Like I said prepare yourself to leave bc if u stay you will be only hurting yourself knowingly and willingly and who knows where you will end up in life. Trust me I’m 2 years sober bc of that decision my ex made we still talk and are friends but it helped me move on and be responsible for my actions and decisions.,1674147255.0
j50eb9l,"Keeping busy helps until you burn out. Depending on public transportation is no joke—I had a very temporary sponsor who lived two bus transfers and a long walk away and it was my issue for not meeting him at his place—wouldn’t I have done that to get one more? And the answer was no. Drugs were more convenient than he was making recovery. Some people will suggest things that are absolutely ridiculous and it’s important to be able to openmindedly consider that option and how it fits into your personal balance, and reject what isn’t helpful. I love the suggestion to look into online meetings. Are there any options near your treatment center? Can you do AA meetings? NA and AA are pretty close all told. I would encourage you to pursue options that are convenient and also be totally sure of how you’re doing. It’s very easy to get into a grind mindset and not pay attention to how you’re feeling and then suddenly want to use because you aren’t getting the rest you need. I think more important than hitting a bare minimum of meetings is what you’re doing at the meetings. Are you getting a sponsor? Are you getting numbers and calling them? When you have a sponsor are you working the steps? It’s not about filling time—12 step groups are called 12 step for a reason. You work the steps. Check out alternative meetings also. I love SMART and Recovery Dharma. Recovery Dharma Chicago has a great online meeting Friday nights at 7 pm CT. I think if you’re hitting those two NA meetings consistently and have some additional support through a third meeting / doing a ton of recovery work with a sponsor you’ll have what you need covered. People underestimate the slog that it is to take public transit. For me if I miss one bus by one minute it used to mean I would get a later train which might be full and I’d have to get the next one. A five minute difference at the start of my commute could lead to an hour difference in when I show up. That’s not nothing. You can also try asking people for rides to meetings, but that’s really hard to ask for until you know someone. Can anyone in your IOP help you out?",1674140923.0

j4zbtaf,More in the beginning is good. But it's not the meetings that will stop you that's on you. Meetings are like benzos that help with withdrawal. You take them to make it possible to even stop but in the long term they're not the solution. I did 3 a week when I started and it helped a lot to stick with it. But until I got to the why what was causing me to drink I was never really getting better. Therapy is really important and to get to the cause of your drinking and what are the alternative safe coping mechanisms that will prevent you from drinking. Learning about what caused your issues and dealing with that helps tremendously. Unfortunately I am always going to be an alcoholic so I can never drink again but at least now the desire to drink is gone and when I get anxiety I know how to deal with it.,1674117336.0

j4yriwi,You need professional help brother. Along with that professional help you need supportive care like meetings and the recovery community. Some people hate it when I say that but I am a professional in the industry and I'm telling you that's what works. Nobody or at least almost nobody gets sober on their own with zero help. And I tell the guys that I coach all the time that oftentimes relapse wears a bra and lipstick. But that's only because I coach only men. If I coached women too I would tell them that relapse often looks like Dudes. What you're telling us is exactly why in the recovery community we recommend not having a relationship during the 1st year. You need stability and consistency in your life (among other things) befor you are able to handle intimate relationships again. Some people will disagree with that but I'm just telling you what I know from my certifications licenses college degrees and good old life experience. Do your self a favor and seek professional help. Get a recovery coach! Best of luck brother 🙏,1674103713.0

j4q8jtb,"Good for you for wanting to get off it and for doing your research before stopping! First off I want to say it is very possible to recover from benzos. However, it has to be done carefully or it can be dangerous and even deadly. If you have the option, seek medical advice. You can get all the advice in the world from the internet (I do highly recommend r/benzorecovery) but no one here knows your full medical history and health status, and no one here will be there to help you in the real world when it gets hard and scary, which unfortunately, it will. Your two options are to either taper off the drug slowly or to detox under medical supervision. The sub I suggested has a lot of advice regarding the tapering option. The Ashton Manual was designed to provide a guide for how much to taper down by and for how long. This is regarded as the safest and least damaging way to get off benzos. Sounds like you have already started tapering down, and this guide could help you determine how to continue tapering down until you’re clean. Still, the more you taper down, the more at risk you are for physical and psychological complications, so I still 100% consulting with your doctor before you make any further changes. If you want to just be done with it and stop taking it completely, find somewhere where you can do a supervised detox. It’s kind of like an inpatient rehab where they give you medications to help reduce seizure and other risks and watch your vitals and stuff to make sure you get through it safely. This is what I did. It wasn’t fun at all, but I just needed to be done with it and wanted to get it over with. However, I would strongly recommend the taper option for anyone with any kind of preexisting medical conditions, because tapering will have a lower seizure risk. You can do this! It’s hard but very possible! Feel free to message me if you have any questions or just need to talk",1673966475.0

One day at a time, do the next right thing. Whatever your path is to sobriety from disordered eating, do the next right step. Maybe call an old therapist or sponsor.

You have to decide what kind of support you need and see if you’re comfortable asking for it. A doctor can do an assessment and see where you are for risk factors and you can go from there. This isn’t your fault. It’s easy for us to slip from remission into relapse without us being fully aware. It’s not always a conscious choice the way other relapses can happen.

j4kf8ce,"Speaking from my personal experience, just because someone gets clean, doesn’t mean they’re a better person. They’ve stopped using, which can help alleviate some of the bad behaviors, but ultimately you have to be willing to put some into yourself. For me getting clean was just the beginning. It took me months (total of 15 months) in treatment, in multiple therapies, and working a recovery program to just begin to make progress on myself and personal relations. I’m still very isolative and guarded. I still act out in bad behavior. I actively avoid relationships, because I don’t want to hurt anyone else in the ways I have in my my addiction. This is a similar experience of my bad behavior, different scale than yours. 7 months into my recovery I had to call up my job and had to quit on the spot, because I plateaued in my recovery from substances and mental health, and was being transferred programs. I did that ALL the time in my using career. I played the victim many times in early recovery, because I hadn’t learned new behaviors yet.

j4fuly1,"It is a really positive thing that you already are aware of your addiction as a lot of people your age do not understand it. I would try to find a rehab in your area. One of the biggest parts of finding sobriety is education about what is happening to your body in addiction. Maybe discuss it with your mom first if you dad is an angry person. You never know though, maybe your dad will understand if you speak to him about it in a matter-of-fact way. If you live in a small town that means you know all the places you can get drugs too, so getting away for a time, to a rehab, will be a big deal. You are also going to have to cut contact with people that use. Whether that be close friends that you have had most of your life or whoever else you are hanging around with. This might make people get upset with you and might make you feel bad for a moment, but you will learn there is no way to hang around people in that lifestyle and stay sober yourself. Their ideas and ways of thinking soon rub off on you and you will go straight back to using. I wish you the best of luck. When I got sober my motto was, ""whatever it takes."" You will have to learn patience and to take things one day at a time. Some days your only task will be to stay sober. And honestly, it doesn't matter what your parents or anyone else thinks.

That being said I think there is a bunch of overlap with alcoholism/addiction and a variety of other mental health complications. The ""insanity"" discussed in the programs isn't really a specific definition either. The phrase, ""one is too many and a thousand is never enough"" sums it up pretty well. The idea being that just one drink or drug will create disaster and a thousand will never solve anything either. So why do either? The alcoholic/addict will try anyway. It's insane. This ""insanity"" will absolutely creep into other aspects of life. We get hateful, resentful, entitled, wrapped up in self pity, etc. All in an attempt to blame anything else for our problems, rather than admitting our own fault. So is your spouse acting insane? Yes. Is it a direct result of addiction? Maybe. Could there be underlying issues exacerbated by drugs/alcohol? Absolutely. There usually is. Would getting sober help with all the possibilities?

j4cyiq0, I'm sorry...that is a tough situation. Legally speaking you are old enough to check into a detox without their knowledge or consent. Not saying that's the best idea but it is an option. Do you have a job or your own money? There are online clinics like Bicycle health where you have an online doctor appointment and they'll prescribe you meds to help you through detox. I know it costs money but idk how much. Idk what your school is like but can you talk to the school counselor for help? If your parents make you go to school sick I think there's a good chance that you're gonna get sent home by the nurse anyway.,1673730031.0

It shows your serious about taking care of your problem and it shows maturity, at least in my opinion as the mom of 2 teenagers. Worst case scenario, is checking into detox an option for you? I think most colleges will let you make up any work you miss with a valid doctor's note. The student health center or whatever may even be able to help you with that.

j4ch5gh,"Look into Smart Recovery. Online meetings for all sorts of addictions. Self Management and Recovery Training-different view than NA. You can do the zoom meetings privately. They’re scattered all through the day. Some are text only, which was great for me, bc my parents didn’t know about my benzo problems, even tho I live with them. They still don’t, I was clean for 19 months, relapsed for 5, clean now for almost 1 month. It’s sucks and it’s hard, and I don’t want to disappoint my parents or cause them any unnecessary stress. A drug counselor recommended smart recovery and said to me: Would it benefit your parents any to know? And I was like no it wouldn’t. She asked if it would benefit me and I said probably not. You gotta do what’s right for you-my sisters aren’t supportive so I don’t discuss anything addiction related with them. I have my own group of recovery friends and Smart meetings I attend privately.

j4cfjod,"My experience is a bit different from yours as I stopped using at 39. But I had kept my drug addiction hidden and a secret for nearly 3 years. It was exhausting for me. And much like you it felt impossible to quit. The shame I felt prevented me from asking for help. I believed I needed to continue to keep up the facade because I had a career. I didn’t want people to look at me differently. Finally my good friend reached out to my mom because my behavior was alarming to him. He suspected I was using (and he was right). My mom called me and confronted me. It was such a huge relief to finally say it out loud and ask for her help. You can do this. It’s hard and uncomfortable, but having your family’s support could be so helpful in your recovery journey. I also wanted to mention NA and AA should be safe spaces for you. Anonymity is crucial. It’s I’m the name. If you’re not ready to talk to your folks, go to some meetings. Others may be able to help you navigate this. I wish you the best and applaud you for seeking guidance.

j4ce12a,Can you maybe start by finding a therapist? You don't necessarily have to tell them it's drug and alcohol counseling if you don't want to. Just be vague and say mental health. It's technically not a lie. Once you get comfortable with the therapist and they know more about you and your family dynamics they can help you with telling your parents. I'm afraid to give you bad advice for telling them directly. My parents knew long before I told them so personally mine were relieved that I got honest. Usually honesty is the best policy but you said your dad takes his anger out on you. If he gets physical with you then definitely seek some help from a professional first. Confidentiality laws are super strict in the US so even if you are on your parents insurance the therapist can't tell them anything without you signing a release.,1673721775.0

My two biggest outlets in the early days were lifting and hiking, both of which I forced myself to try while in treatment. Lifting was great because my hard work had extremely tangible results in my body and my numbers, and it was hard to find the energy to be anxious when I left it all at the gym. Hiking was great because the silence of the outdoors helped quiet my mind, it also provided a reason to take some road trips to see national parks which were really cheap trips compared to staying in a big city or going to Disney or something.

Your feelings are your feelings and while it may be hard to control your feelings, understanding them is what is key.

There are phases where it is easier and phases where they’re more difficult, this is true for so many aspects in life. I find during the more difficult times, going back to the basics helps the most. Think back to your first days, weeks, months of being clean and sober and what you were doing to help you get through those times and maybe go back to doing those things that helped you the most. As far as judging those others for doing what they are doing it’s a natural human instinct to judge, but again examine where in yourself these judgments are coming from and of course the old saying walk a mile in their shoes comes to mind. Everyone’s path is different everyone’s path has barriers and obstacles the best way to get through those are through understanding your own self.

Recovery communities are typically full of altruistic people who help themselves by helping others. It was/is a good way for me to talk with new people. I think this might really work with what you are searching for. Hit some meetings, find ones you are willing to keep going back to for a few weeks. When someone shares something you find helpful, let them know after the meeting. A classic, ""hey, I found what you said really helpful and/or inspiring. I've got -insert challenge- going on and I think what you said/doing what you said is gonna help"". Leave it at that. Keep from diving too deep into a ""woe is me"" conversation. It's so weird being introverted lol. I kinda think that I am and I'm ok with it. Primarily because I believe that there are certain extroverted people who compliment that. Not everyone is so don't get discouraged by those who aren't. You might have many ""one off"" conversations. It's ok, consider it practice cause it is. Eventually you will find people you vibe with and will do just that, vibe. I don't dwell on whether I'm introverted or not either.

It is nice to network, but make sure you also stick close to ones with real world lasting experience in recovery. I did the networking and fun peer hanging out.

j430xf1,"I didn't cut back in substances that long but I hope my story can give you a perspective of what a future could look like. TLDR: Depression is fucked up, look for people who accept you as you are, learn to love yourself, achievement comes only AFTER you feel like you're worth a damn. I've been struggling with depression for huge parts of my life and have used alcohol and weed daily to treat it for the last 2.5 years until about the last half of last year. I don't feel bad about using because that was the only way for me to deal with my reality. However, that reality was a really negative way of seeing the world around me and of treating myself like shit because I thought that was what I deserved. (And that was how others treated me) My cure was ending up in a place where people liked and even loved me just for being myself, with all my flaws and imperfections. I was welcome at my neighbors even when I had no money, no job and most importantly, no self-esteem. I could even eat along with their dinner and would return the favor later as soon as I got the chance but without them even expecting that. I smoked weed and drank with them as well, but I still see that time as the most crucial and first period of my recovery. I needed to feel loved and accepted before I could change the behavior caused by a disturbed view of myself and the world around me. To answer your question: on the moment it feels like there's nothing to look forward to, imagine yourself surrounded by genuinely good people; eating together, laughing together and truly having fun. These people exist somewhere, but you have to find them. You laughing? It can happen, even though it might take a while to get there. You just have to find the right place and the right people for you and be willing to sacrifice your comfort in order to get there. I dont know your personal struggle and life is fucking cold sometimes so 'fuck it' is the easiest way to keep things exactly the same. But the reason you posted this is not because you're completely fucked, it's because you already know you're not (yet).

I'm about to finish my studies in my 10th year since I first started it and I've been in a relationship for about a year with a girl who loves me whether I'm an addict or not. Most days I still have a hard time getting out of bed, but I'm not going down without a fucking fight, even if it's my own head bringing me down. If you told me 10 years ago I would be genuinely happy someday I would've laughed in your face (just kidding, i was depressed) Dude, you're awesome. You're fighting your own fucking head and even getting reinforcements from Reddit (Reddinforcements?) so you're a warrior imo. Sorry for being so fucking optimistic because I can imagine this might not help when you feel like shit but I hope you can imagine a day in your future where you won't be miserable.

j42p31o,"You know I can relate. I used to love drinking for what I used call the 'narcotic' effect of alcohol and I used to take other stuff to amplify it. I drank for this effect for many years but nearer the end I found that feeling typically more illusive. My drinking escalated and progressed and I was not drinking for enjoyment .I was drinking to cope, to sleep ,to function and eventually everyday just to stop shaking and paranoia. It was fucking horrible. Either constantly pissed or in a state of perpetual hangover. I'm guessing you didn't go that far with your drinking and I really hope you don't ever and if you are stopping now to avoid the slide then all power to you. Steps 2 and 3 are required because the programme relies on a spiritual element in order to help the recovering alcoholic to stop thinking they are in control of everything and everyone. Early recovery for many is hard and its comforting to accept a higher power in your life , having said that I know a few recovered alcoholics who will never accept a higher power concept but they still stay sober and clean in the fellowship. Many people really struggle with the word God and will walk out of an AA meeting as soon as they see it, some straight to the cemetery sadly but those that stay find it in AA it means how you perceive and understand a higher presence. For some it is just the power of the meeting and that works for a lot of people. I have sponsee now who is atheist but his higher power or God head is the meetings and members themselves. Accepting a lot of the 12 steps doesn't always come over night and I took quite a while because although I thought I had , I didn't t get or fully accept step 1 for years!

My job has a lot of strict deadlines and this week I’ve been waking up everyday with really intense anxiety, most of the time dry heaving/throwing up before I head out then pull over on the way to work to do it some more. After years and years of anxiety though, I’ve kinda become detached from it. I focus on maintaining a balance of pushing myself while also meeting basic needs(sleep, good food, down time etc). If I know in my mind that I’m doing everything I can to get my work done while also maintaining health and sanity, I can rest easier at night. Not letting my anxiety related symptoms get me down also helps me a lot. Even though I might get shaky, feel nauseous, or whatever, getting in my own head and focusing in on it is only going to magnify the feelings I’m trying to get away from in the first place. On the flip side, I find myself almost being comforted by letting those anxious/depressed feelings take over me. Now I have a reason to rest and my pain is more legitimized. This turns into a negative feedback loop for me though, where everything starts feeling overwhelming and all I want to do is hide under the covers in bed.

j3zxfgm,"Sure, sorry for the delay, I am an inconsistent redditor. Unbroken Brain is my favorite, it is very well researched and easy to read, it has some of the most fascinating ideas about understanding how abuse disorder develops and the spectrum of treatment options. Maia is precise about language and explores scientific evidence based treatment. I really appreciate the neutral and unemotional tone with which the information is presented also. Annie Grace’s work is also evidence based and looks at the brain and alcohol. What is different about her work is that it doesn’t posit that the patient has a spiritual disease like 12 step does, it asks instead what is wrong with this substance. As she educates you on the truth about alcohol, she also presents recovery as possible and not only possible but full of agency. Your recovery goal is not predetermined as abstinence, you choose a path based on the recovery outcome you desire. Annie also has tons of free content online, her YT channel features interviews with lots of people who have encountered abuse disorder whether with substances or processes and have chosen a wide variety of recovery paths. She does a great job of featuring a really diverse buffet of recovery options. Sober for Good is an overview of many different recovery tools and programs ranging from 12 step to SMART etc, it is also neutral in tone and well referenced. I suggest it bc I think it is essential for the patient to know what their options are for putting together a life in recovery that they want to protect and show up for. Recovery has to be more than sobriety and for me personally, that has meant a very diverse oeuvre of approaches and tools. When I started this journey I had a lot of 12 step shoved down my throat and at one point I was actually suicidal bc I was so unhappy in 12 step and believed it was the only way. I would never want to take a tool from a recovering person that works for them, but beginning to understand that there are many paths was so important to me feeling empowered to chose life and to chose life without alcohol over and over. I hope this helps and makes sense. I am on the vivitrol shot also and it has helped with my physical cravings so much, as well as given me the psychological security of knowing there’s no point. I attend Recovery Dharma, SMART, Women for Sobriety, She Recovers, and bc 12 step dominates and I can’t do it alone I do go to some 12 step mtgs. I go to adult children and SLAA even though I am not a sex addict and it’s because the content of the meeting is about healing developmental trauma and about emotional sobriety and I found once the withdrawals are gone and abstinence (if that’s your goal) is achieved the things I struggle with are things like boundaries, attachment issues, emotional anorexia, etc. I also go to 2 professionally led process groups to help maintain a sense of support.

Once is intentionality...taking drugs and the other is what they do to the person whatever their intentions are. Many people continue to take drugs for medical conditions that help them in one are but hurt them mentally or limit the change process. It's important to look at it and put it all on the table. To see if there is another path. If not that's fine.

Getting clean is the easy part, staying clean, that's the hard part. Different drug, but I think still applies.. when I got off heroin it left a massive hole in my life the drug was filling. It was essential for me to re-engage with things I enjoyed before the drugs, old hobbys etc, to fill that hole with things that aren't drug related.

Those goofballs mess thing up for a while and I was honestly in a state of work and sleep only for around 6 months until I started feeling some remnant of motivation and joy in anything. Weed helped big time during this period, eventually stopped smoking weed entirely and got the motivation to go try something new. Now a days I'm a licensed pest control tech and discovered my love for scuba diving as well as made new friends in a community I've grown to know and care for deeply. At the end of the day for me it wasn't all about just getting off of the drugs it was about filling my life with some sort of purpose and joy as I was lacking that entirely after getting sober. Without that key thing I'd be using to this day.",1673359518.0
j3qymbo,"This is basically a 12 step sub (power to those it worked for - MAT saved my life) so every suggestion is going to be to do that but personally I'd talk to your partner directly and ask them what could help and how they're feeling because no one in a group can tell you that, especially not alanon. Alanon is very helpful if you need support for yourself but they are not addicts and will only give you outside observations from their interactions with their specific addict, which is even less helpful than going to a normal 12 step and listening to addicts speak to learn about the addiction experience. If you don't feel you can broach the topic therapists can help. Meth doesn't have much of a physical withdrawal (compared to other drugs and I've been addicted to IV meth for a lot of my addiction so I'm not just saying that) so by 30 days out he should be feeling ""ok"" but the real problem is that meth fries your dopamine and norepinephrine on a worse level than other drugs. Especially with doing it for a decade, it is very unlikely there will be a pink cloud of sobriety with that shit. I was addicted to fentanyl for a couple years and got some level of pink cloud when I would try to quit, started shooting goofballs daily the last year and there really are no words to describe the emptiness and all consuming depression that followed in sobriety, and that's with being on methadone as well. It will take a long time to heal the receptors and he likely will not feel happiness, excitement, or joy for really anything in the mean time which is a stark contrast from the ungodly amazing feeling that meth is. I would worry about this and the relative boredom being the biggest relapse triggers Honestly I am skeptical that a 30 day program will be enough for someone who was using meth a decade. If 12 step meetings aren't his thing I would definitely recommend doing SOMETHING more, even if just individual therapy sessions. I wouldn't bother with drug tests unless you believe for sure he relapsed cause that doesn't build trust and addicts know how to get around it if they have advance notice, and meth doesn't stay as long as some other drugs. He's gotta fill his time with something else and stay busy. Job, sober friends, working out, hobbies, you just don't want to be alone and bored ever. Push for him to cut contact with using friends and get all dealers out of his phone - if he won't do this he probably isn't ready. Addiction takes up a lot of time and energy and if you remove that without adding any other activities or things to look forward to then that 6m-1 yr+ post acute withdrawal drag is going to be agonizing and difficult to get through.",1673358952.0

j3p5ss9,"This sounds like you have a low dopamine situation. This is understandable. One big thing that can help it takes time each day to do 2 things. Sit down and observe your thoughts as they unravel through your head. Like really let them run wild and just watch them with an attitude similar to watching a puppy play with a new toy; with curiosity and non judgment. After you've done that for about 10 minutes, move to another practice where you're actively letting go of your thoughts and focusing on your breathing. The idea here is now to release your thoughts after you've taken time to hang out with them, and practice putting your attention in your body. You might have a slight case of disassociation (I cannot diagnose btw). But either way, practice getting into your body and feeling your emotions and bodily sensations can be very grounding. Just be with your breath for about 10 minutes. So essentially you are watching your thoughts through a non judgemental lense, just letting them go, you're allowing yourself to observe the nature of your mind without changing anything or judging it. Then your practicing putting attention on your body and making friends with your self neck down.

To give an example, he talks about several particular ideas that people have that can interfere with life. E.g. delayed gratification vs instant gratification, which might explain how someone with bad money habits who wins Powerball winds up broke and miserable. Or, IIRC ""Sins of Our Fathers"" which refers to being willing to question ideas and perspectives that have been handed down via culture or religion but that might not actually be good ideas (Ill use slavery as an example).

j3i6s39,"One thing to be careful of is that unlike drugs that boost your dopamine (alcohol, coke, amphetamines), MDMA depletes your serotonin, and serotonin replenishes a lot slower, so you can really burn out those receptors. If you're not careful, you can get serotonin syndrome, which can be a lifelong affliction; I met an old man who can't take SSRIs because he burnt out those receptors. Deeply unhappy guy. There's a supplement called 5HTP that will help replenish your lost serotonin. It's a godsend, but obviously MDMA is bad for you in a lot of other ways. It can cause damage to your spinal fluid -- I don't know how true those sayings about it putting holes in your brain are, but it is something I've heard of. If anything, think of your poor teeth you're grinding! Not trying to scare or shame you, though. I'm just wary of this drug, because unlike alcohol, opiates, or hard stimulants, Molly can do a lot of damage really quickly.

No judgment, I've bought plenty of illegal drugs in my life, including benzos. How did it feel when you relapsed? Good for a little bit, I assume, but did you rebound worse? Can you get more xanax? If taking 0.5 helped you, and you can get more, then you could try taking 0.5 every day. Then you reduce that a little bit every day over a few weeks until you get to zero. My experience is that it's really hard to taper xanax because it doesn't last very long and you go in and out of withdrawal during the day. But if you can get a prescription for klonopin or valium or something like that, it's a lot easier to taper those. Benzo withdrawal is not something I personally thing you should ""push through"". It's better to take enough of the drugs to be (mostly) comfortable, and then to taper them really slowly and then jump from a low level.

(I am assuming. Correct me if I'm wrong.) In the mix of that there are entanglements of distrust and fear and hope and anger. Those take time to unwind. Deep breathing and calming mantras helped me. ""This will pass"", ""nothing bad is happening"" whatever works for your situation. They need to heal, too. You probably (just based on general assumptions) wreaked all manner of havoc on their lives in ways you may not even know.",1673105902.0

You might find benefits in sharing your experience here or sites like Quora as well. I have done a lot of interaction on both for the subject over time. It was a choppy road to this position of health. For example the first time I tried Vyvanse, I only had 30 days sober from meth. The medication still worked well immediately upon taking it but I had one more meth relapse about 2.5 months after starting it. The last and final time I went back on Vyvanse I had been dabbling in Kratom but had 10 months clean from meth but this time it stuck for good and I’ve got 26 months clean now.

j32pgrh,"To control my sleeping anxiety I had to learn to accept that as long as I was anxious or upset about not sleeping the more my mind would get carried away and the more anxious I got and the more I worried and then the sleep would never come and then the entire cycle would start over… So my dr prescribed me trazodone, which helped, but my anxiety (and withdrawals from benzos, still made sleeping extremely difficult) So I got a lot of pillows and comfortable blankets and I put a tv in my bedroom and I lowered the air conditioning, and I started just watching tv all night long, and in return my mind started focusing on what I was watching and not on how crappy I was feeling and my worrying was silenced by watching the tv. Eventually I started to be able to relax while watching tv every night and I started being able to drift off to sleep for a small amount of time, and with alot more time I started being able to sleep thru the night. (I was originally on 300 mg trazodone, 2 mg of Xanax, 10 mg of Ambien and 2 opiates to sleep. After a very long and painful withdrawal, I only take 100 of trazodone…) It is a long excruciating (both physical and mental) recovery, but it is soooooo much better now, and I am getting better sleep now than I have ever had in my life.

I mainly like to find ways I can be useful to others or ways I can give back or bring joy to others because that brings me joy. All of the ""I feel"" or ""I want"" or ""I wish"" stuff isn't ""I am"". Who I am is based on no external thing. It's not a mood, a desire, a disease, or any type of illness. Those are things that afflict me. I choose who I am and what I am to be, everything else is external. This was a tough fact to face, to put it lightly. It meant I had to assume total responsibility for myself.

It’s just an idea, moving outside the self ironically can really help you to find some sense of self.

I understand your aversion to AA due to the religious aspect. I shared that as well when I first got sober, but if you're open-minded, you can follow the system of AA without adhering to any religion. It's really a spiritual program, not a religious one. Aside from having a near death experience which led me to rekindle spiritual belief, I grew a belief system of hierarchy of self; consciousness ( I ) being the highest form, the mind being a subordinate and most importantly trainable aspect of that consciousness, and the body being a subordinate of both ( Me ).

AA/NA will not make you do anything you don’t want, but to start your recovery you have to be be willing and open minded because if you don’t take suggestions and change then you will continue the same cycle. A addict can give you the best advice if they are truly sober because of experience. I suggest counseling and networking with other addicts where ever you feel safe. Being alone in recovery is extremely hard because you will stay in your own head quite a bit and make bad decisions. you should meet people and socialize more so you can speak with people who can relate and help you through the hard times “not all counselors have dealt with a drug addiction” . Unfortunately we just don’t know everything and what helped me was people with a addiction who has stayed clean and felt the pains I’ve felt. You may not be comfortable being honest with just one person but you may meet someone who you are willing to be more open with. you have to deal with your trauma by being honest and telling someone so they know where to start in dealing with it with you, so you can let it go.

My frustration was that I got hooked on drugs I “needed” to function like everyone else (amphetamines, etc.) it took me a while to realize that the reason I kept going back so frequently was that when I was sober for a week or a few months or even TWO years I always had this thought in my head that I was at a deficit. I hated using but I hated feeling dumb or not capable / competent. So I would go back. Over and over. Trying to be a me that I couldn’t sustain in a life that I couldn’t maintain. The whole acceptance that even tho I didn’t know who I would be when I was sober, it would be better than who I fought to portray. Does that make sense? End of the day, I needed to learn to love me and all my differences. It helped a lot in early sobriety. You aren’t “fixing” yourself. You are rediscovering yourself and your life.

j2q6lsg,"Cannabinoid Hyperemesis is a condition where benzos are known to help treat it. It's a rather new phenomenon that seems to be associated with daily long term chronic use of medical marijuana. They really don't know why it is happening to some people but essentially it starts shutting down your digestive system. They believe it's related to Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome which is also believed to be triggered by emotional stress and anxiety. The main symptoms tend to be waking up at 3 to 5am in the morning with horrible vomiting episodes and you can vomit almost nonstop up to 10x an hour. It also seems to cause extreme acid reflux, heartburn, cramps, headaches, belching and even death in a few instances. It's no joke! Going beyond the Hyperemesis thing which is pretty specific to me. I noticed that the Klonopin started making me more anxious actually and in the past two weeks my anxiety has actually settled down a good bit to where it is absolutely way better and easier managed than the past 5 years I was on Klonopin. Benzos are known to work rather paradoxically after you've been on them for a long time. They actually seem to exacerbate panic attacks and for me they absolutely did that and more. I'm not sure if I'm going through this CHS thing or if it is all just a byproduct of my Klonopin use. Honestly I kind of think it is both.

For myself personally, I hit a point where the Klonopin no longer actually did anything for my anxiety and if anything it made it worse. That final .25mg is tough and the symptoms you describe are not abnormal. Although for me what was worse is I started having crazy stomach cramps, waking up in the middle of the night nauseous and vomiting uncontrollably but weirdly this had nothing to do with the actual withdrawal. It was as if Klonopin was treating some other physical health problems I have. I had to quit smoking weed entirely as well because I found weirdly that seems to be what was causing the cramps and extreme vomiting. It ruined my appetite, made me feel rundown because I was up half the night unable to sleep for months. I believe with about 95% certainty that the Klonopin was actually treating a condition called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis. I say all this for a few reasons. For one I absolutely believe you are simply going through rebound symptoms. The other point is that you will get better though but because of the long half life of the drug it takes a few months for your body to reset at the minimum. Maybe talk to your doctor about safe non narcotic alternatives that could help alleviate some of these symptoms when they get bad. It could be worse though too so hang in there! Coming off of this stuff takes strength and you should be applauded for being smart enough to figure it out yourself!",1672705927.0

Eventually you wont be craving at all. I party harder now than I did when I was drinking, just sober, which is better because I wake up the next day and I can hit the gym, spend time with my wife whatever. In terms of things that I do that don't revolve partying, I play video games, ski, travel. I try to travel 3-5 times per year, at at least one international trip. This year is Japan for 3 weeks.

If it's not an intoxicant of some sort, then it probably won't get you arrested. THC is an intoxicant. Intoxicants are generally contraindicated with sobriety. I mean, it's literally the exact opposite of being sober. However, there are degrees. I think that THC is about the mildest intoxicant there is, except maybe psilocybin. I, myself, don't consider THC to be ""breaking my sobriety."" But, I'm also not 2 weeks off of meth and opiates. I guess I'd want to ask a question - what does ""2 weeks clean"" - does that mean that the last time she used was 2 weeks ago? Is this her first time getting sober? Let's play a little thought game. You're going to assert that ""THC is not a drug"" - and then I'm going to say ""ok, then, you should be totally cool going without it for the next year."" That's what's generally recommended, at a minimum - give it a year. Because if you need it, then you need it for a reason. Unless you need it for something that you are getting a prescription from a doctor \with whom you have a dr/patient relationship\ - then you are using it as an intoxicant.",1702961662.0

Getting loaded will only make things worse, in recovery there’s hope for the future. I’d recommend blocking J’s number and getting honest with your therapist. This is, unfortunately, a very common experience in treatment centers so I’m sure they’ll have some strategies. Something I often bring up when sharing at my treatment center’s alumni center is that when I first arrived I met a guy who I was certain was The One. I was head over heels and imagining our wedding. Fortunately, he was involved with my roommate while stringing me along so nothing happened with us. In the years since, it turns out he and I have such different beliefs that we can’t even be Facebook friends, never mind romantic partners. My judgement was really bad when I was freshly sober because I had zero experience engaging in healthy romantic relationships and just meeting a hot guy who ✨understood✨ me felt like magic.

k794lef,"having seizures after 8 weeks of sobriety from benzos/alcohol is just about the very upper limit. as i said in one of my previous comments most wilderness programs (and certainly any program i recommend) require patients that are within a certain timeframe of their last dose to spend a MINIMUM of 3-7 days ina detox program where you are under 24 hour supervision by medical+recovery professionals. i assumed most people that had an awareness of how wilderness programs worked knew this which is why i didn’t explicitly mention the detox aspect, but it is a huge liability for a wilderness program to take a patient who is still at risk of having a seizure and i haven’t really heard of it happening. you have to be medically cleared before entering a wilderness program. so basically i’m not sure why you feel the need to point out “ absurdity of a wilderness program for anyone who's still withdrawing from a substance that will literally kill them” when that’s not at all what i was suggesting. i am also starting to feel like you are taking what i am saying personally since i never said you weren’t sober or that recovery didn’t work for you, i just assumed you had prior experience with a wilderness program since you were so adamant about them not working. i also didn’t send it out as a blanket remedy. i recognize that not everyone can/wants to do a wilderness program so i gave two options, the other being jaywalker lodge in carbondale. i don’t feel like i have suggested anyone do anything dangerous, nor have i said that there is only one way to detox/recover so im not sure what you are so worked up about.",1698772416.0

It’s relatively high end, comfortable, and I guarantee you’ll be with other people in a similar situation as yourself. In my experience having people surrounding you that you can relate to makes a world of difference. It’s reputable, but out of the way enough that plenty of public figures have been through there. I’ve had a couple horrific experiences being too hasty in choosing a detox/treatment center and it was a complete nightmare. Also, I would suggest choosing a place objectively. You may end up at the place someone suggested because they had a “life changing” experience there only to find out it’s essentially a locked psych ward with AA meetings once a day (may or may not be speaking from experience).

But it was the crack that made things spiral and almost ruined me. I went to an intensive outpatient rehab, but I had my family and partner keep really tight tabs on me (with my permission). Otherwise I would say an inpatient rehab is a good idea. If you can go without the crack and stop seeing anyone you could get it from completely, if gets easier once you are over the initial shock of being sober.

I just felt like a rush all the sudden of feeling like things weren’t real but I could still go through the motions (it happened at work). I could still finish my tasks but it was all robotic it’s hard to explain. My biggest symptom was obviously insomnia but tingly feet was a big one, dizziness, panic, sweating, no appetite, stomach issues. The very first WD I feel is the tingly feet. I rapid tapered from 6mg a day for 3 years to 3 mg/day within a day, and 2.5 the next couple days to 2.25 a day. Couldn’t budge from there because I needed 1.75mg to sleep. I could at least look forward to that. But I was used to using approx 4mg spread through the day and 2mg to sleep, to using .5 spread through the day and 1.75mg to sleep. It was terrifying. Just the panic from realizing I was gonna be out in a few days was worse than anything. Now I have enough to do the extremely slow taper they recommend online. Main reason besides hating being on something that I may die or seize if I run out, is how much it has messed up my brain. My memory is shit and I swear, I’m just nowhere near as sharp.

k4njeas,"I think most everyone would like to be able to do it on there own without having to take a prescription medication in order to stay away from other prescription medications. On paper, all of it sounds counterproductive. But it’s only counterproductive if you make it that way. You have to go all in. No selling your subs for $ if you have extras left over. Don’t take more than the recommended dosage from your doctor. Don’t do other drugs with it (i.e. amphetamines, benzodiazepines, etc.) unless approved and prescribed by your doctor. Don’t loan anybody any subs. It’s ok to be selfish with your recovery. You need to take care of you. If you don’t make your recovery your #1 priority then everything else will fall apart. I say this bc I know for a lot of people that selling some of their suboxone script is tempting but that keeps you in the loop with a crowd that you’ve gotta keep your distance from. Taking an extra dose here & there can cause you to run out early if you don’t do a weekly count of your meds bc then you risk running out early which puts you at risk of experiencing withdrawals. We don’t want that bc we all know as addicts where that might lead us. I went to a place called Cedar Recovery for my suboxone. I LOVED it there. They recruited me to speak with one of their in office therapist every visit, and I really benefitted from that. I learned the difference between guilt and shame, and how I should never be ashamed of what I’ve done in the past bc those actions don’t define me as a person. I can feel guilty for it but I do not need to be ashamed of who I am, and neither do you. It also taught me to be ok with where I’m currently at and to stop stressing about what I needed to do or where I should be in my recovery & in life in general. I constantly thought to myself “I’ve been on suboxone for too long like I need to get off” and my therapist said, what’s wrong with being happy with where you’re at right now? Because you’re doing really great & making amazing progress. MAT (medicated assisted treatment) is so much more than just taking Suboxone to not feel sick from withdrawals. It’s a treatment plan that is designed to assist you in your recovery. There’s nothing wrong with needing that. Also, if you’re worried that you might not be able to manage a script, they do have the suboxone shot now that lasts for like 6 weeks. It’s a time released shot that releases so many milligrams into your system every few hours. I almost did it, but I wanted to prove to myself that I could manage & take a script correctly as directed by my doctor, and I was successful in doing that.

I went to detox for a week to start and they put me on the equivalent of 5mg of Xanax a day for 2.5 days then cut it to 2mg for two days then discharged me on day 7. I got so bad I was hallucinating despite being given benzos while in there. Ended up in the ER with 180/110 blood pressure once the withdrawal fully set back in after detox and had to taper for a couple of months before going to a 30 day detox. Even after the full 30 days the plane ride home felt like I was riding a roller coaster the entire time because my senses were so fucked up and my face looked all warped in the mirror and my heart palpated every 10 seconds for two months. I finally began to feel normal in the last month but now I got surprise seizures and have had 3 in the last month and can't drive until I go 6 months without one. Let that be a cautionary tale for OP!

Hanging out in bars or pubs. Sitting around drinking with people that you mainly drink with, or sitting in your flat and drinking alone. “Nature abhors a vacuum”, so you need to replace the old activities with new activities that support your life without alcohol. This means finding people, groups, hobbies etc. The first thing you might consider is finding a person who has been sober a while and knows why you’re going through. Kind of like a mentor, this is a person who won’t judge you so you can be honest with them. Where to find the person and the other people are the challenges. Some people go to 12 step groups. The social aspect of these groups is their strength, but the dogma included in the steps is something I don’t care for. That being said, you can distinguish the people who are serious about recovery from the others and make some friends. You Can also use a therapist for this purpose.

It will seem hard for a few days but it will get easier over time. It takes about 6 months for your prefrontal cortex to return (mostly) to normal after long term use.

It was such a brutal feedback loop of trauma bond highs and lows feeding into drug consumption. I've found it very difficult at points to wrap my head around taking accountability for my actions while also maintaining the compassion I need to hold for myself in order to heal and meaningfully sort through everything. At first it brought up so much shame and grief I started feeling suicidal. My sponsor had me wait until I started therapy to begin my fourth step because recalling the past is so re-traumatizing. For the longest time I felt like I was in a purgatory waiting to do the fourth step, not quite understanding what was my part versus what he manipulated me into believing. All those memories hold so much shame. Such a degrading experience. I'm glad I did wait because I'm starting to see that my ptsd was causing me to internalize much of the abuse as my fault and judgement on my character that aligned with the ways he saw me.

juyy76c,"To be fair, I used Adderall which is similar-ish but not quite the same. By far, the worst was at first. I was exhausted, lethargic, and bummed. It felt really real even though I knew it was chemical (it takes a few days for your body to notice it isnt flooded with feelgood chemicals, and starts ramping up production). Some days the best I could do was lie in bed and watch TV and scroll Reddit. Obviously not everything has changed, there. I was working at the time so I would just drink coffee or Monster drinks to excess to give some sort of stimulation even though it wasnt the same. Id say it's a bit like filling a flat tire. From empty you get up to 20 psi in like the first 2 months, then to 30 psi in 6 more months, then up to 35 psi in 6 more months. First phase is body starting to make feelgood chemicals. 2nd phase is body making full amount. 3rd phase is brain's receptors healing so the full amount works how it should. The last two actually overlap and happen at the same time but its an easy way to think of it. Im less than a year off from it entirely and I feel 95% as good as I did before starting to use. Some days I have good energy and mood all day without much effort. Once a week or so Ill feel bummed for a day, a bit more sluggish and just want to chill and be lazy.

Not that I recommend relapsing, but I find it’s easier (for me, at least) to stay clean if I don’t look at a potential relapse as a doomsday, life ruining, starting all over from day 1 event. I just woke up so idk if that makes sense, but I heard someone on a podcast (I think it was a guest of Annie Grace) reframing relapse that way and it’s probably been the most helpful thing for me staying sober and quickly getting back on my feet if/when I stumble. Why do you feel like you made a mistake moving to a new country and starting over? Do you think you’d have an easier time being clean while still being surrounded by your old environment and acquaintances? You made a badass move, brave as hell I think! Oh, another thing that came to my mind: in the first couple years of my sobriety I was suddenly aware of a slew of physical and mental issues coming to the surface that had been covered up for years with substance abuse.

You’d be surprised how many kids on college campuses are doing meth without knowing lol So yeah it’s not great - but a lot of synthesis is made with pharm or lab grade ingredients. It’s not the same as 20 year ago trailer park meth. But a dose too high is a dose too high for anyone. It’ll be an especially bad time. Doesn’t mean you got the same grade. But you won’t be changed forever this one time. Especially since you’re having a negative reaction and connotation. It’s not like you’re doomed to a life of scabs and decayed teeth from here on out. So let go of some of the mental image from movies. That’s half your panic attack. It’s not like you do meth once and you’re a meth head. Addicts making this mistake could have drastically different results. Not recommended for anyone because stims are highly addictive. Just be more careful and now you know. Take a ton of micro nutrients, water and electrolytes, force down a protein shake. Edit: Once you’ve come down; I really like this stuff Irwin Naturals 5-htp at cvs _HYPERLINK_",1690921886.0
jue3qp4,"Yes, naltrexone is an extremely strong drug. They had to check my liver function through a blood test before prescribing me 50mg naltrexone pills. I wanted to go into the Vivitrol shot as well, but me and my doctor agreed to trying the pills for a couple weeks to make sure the side effects were manageable. Since after taking the Vivitrol shot, it would last a month and I wouldn't be able to stop it's release even if I have horrible side effects. The doctor recommended that I start with a quarter or half a pill in the beginning and slowly titrate up to a full 50mg naltrexone pill. I thought that it wouldn't be that bad, I can handle whatever, I'll just go ahead and try a full 50mg pill. For the next 3 days, I was hit with horrible nausea, fatigue, and other side effects.

So, I joined a SMART recovery group and I do their virtual meetings once in a while. Like others have said, anyone can go to meetings. If you’re worried about whether or not you need treatment, you’ll need to see a medical provider and take whatever the name is for the local substance abuse assessment is. You can’t just go to rehab and ask to be checked in to inpatient.

Personally, I recommend not drinking for the reason above but also, if you're trying to be part of a supportive recovery community, it might be difficult to be fully engaged with them if you're drinking or smoking weed.

My experience is staying away from everything is helpful but not needed. I drink very occasionally and smoke weed daily. Maintained to stay away from opiates for nearly 9 years now. I wouldn’t recommend smoking and drinking for people new to recovery but it isn’t impossible to cut out some things but not others just more challenging.

jt04shq,"Based on your comment you may want to ask more about their program. A lot of treatment centers heavily rely on group therapy. While group is important, especially if you want a meeting based support system after treatment, it’s not the best way to get to core personal issues. See if they include individual treatment and what the frequency of that individual treatment is. I’d also suggest looking closely at the credentials of the counselors. If they are strictly chemical dependency counselors they may not have expertise/comfort dealing with other issues. With that said, dealing with core issues likely won’t make craving substances go away. This is considered a biopsychosocial condition. Meaning there are biological, psychological, and social/environmental aspects to it. Substance use can also change brain chemistry, esp. through learning so you will need to learn new things. If your housing, work, etc. is stable outpatient can be a good place to learn/practice. You may start thinking of a mental health counselor instead but I’d only recommend that if that person has expertise in substance use disorders. Mental health counselors can be uncomfortable addressing substance use and ignore/minimize it and make everything only about other issues. If you aren’t interested in 12 steps I’d add you may want to look into SMART Recovery.",1690037101.0

jsu8e8h,"It doesn't matter how old you are or how much time has passed. If you keep waiting for the perfect time, it will never come. I'm 26 and have worked since I was 14 and have nothing because I've been a lifelong addict. I quit all hard drugs over a year ago after spending time in rehab following a surprise intervention. I never wanted to quit and never thought I could quit but I honestly feel better now than I have in my entire life. I quit my stressful job and tried some classes before deciding it wasn't for me and I ended up getting a great job just a couple months ago and even though I'm still living with my parents my life has drastically improved in every way. If you have the financial means to do so, I highly recommend just focusing on yourself instead of going to school or working full time, unless you need it to stay busy. I personally found full time school to be much more work than I expected and the stress was going to make me start using again so I finished out the semester and I don't think I'll ever go back, especially since it turns out I didn't even need the degree for the job I wanted that I already got. But getting out of the house and having a productive routine is absolutely necessary if you're not doing anything else. Don't beat yourself up about the past. Just try and heal and move on. Everyone has things that go on in their life and I honestly don't think your classmates would bat an eye at your prior absence if you want to go back to school.

jsowey1,"I was put on Clonazepam 5mg fifteen years ago which should have never happened. I was going through a very bad break-up, which of course caused me terrible anxiety and my script-happy Psych doc said ""here, take these."" I remember asking him ""How long do I have to be on these?"" and he said ""Forever."" Fast forward fifteen years (early 50s) and I begin to notice that work is becoming more and more difficult for me. I transpose numbers. I would read something and then forget it immediately. I would send long, detailed emails to coworkers and then send basically the same email the next morning BECAUSE I FORGOT I ALREADY SENT THIS. I couldn't concentrate, I made mistakes all the time, and it was getting worse by the day. I would come in to the office some days and for the first few hours I literally could not grasp what it was I needed to do. Horrific. After losing two very good jobs I decided it was time to get off the Clonazepam. The medical community had just become confident in the cognitive impairment caused by long term Benzo use and based on my rapidly-increasing mental decline, I knew it was time. Um, not so easy. I had tried at least five times in five different ways to taper off. I tried two different doctors. I ended up in the ER. I couldn't do it. And then I found a young doctor via telehealth who immediately switched me over to Diazepam (Valium) because it has a longer half-life than other Benzos. It was the only way I was able to gradually reduce my dosage and kick Benzos for good - and I was able to do it in six months. (I must say, however, that after Benzoing myself out of several good jobs I was flat broke and without insurance and I could no longer afford a doctor or meds. This was towards the end of my Valium taper and it forced me to taper off once and for all (blessing in disguise and all that). My memory and all of the other issues stuck around for a bit but after 8 or 9 months post-Benzos I finally turned a corner. I think I quit them just in time and I believe as of today I have recovered most of my faculties. The memory loss is at least 75% improved. I know it sounds like this was a breeze for me but believe me it was not. I was on Clonazepam for fifteen years and the last five were spent trying to get off this awful drug that was rotting my brain. What I would recommend to anyone going through this journey with Klonopin or Xanax is to ask your doctor if moving laterally to Valium is an option. Had it not been for that change (and yeah, okay, not being able to afford the stuff) I would still be taking Benzos.

We have to adhere to the principles and fundamentals laid out before us. There is a reason why it works. And that is the 12 steps, that is the 12 traditions.

jqvej12,"I stopped abusing drugs 4 years ago and I have gone through something similar. It is really wierd living life sober when you're used to the roller coaster that is substance abuse. You kinda need to learn it all again. I still don't really know how to make friends as an adult, as I came into adulthood while abusing. I has gotten better with time. Your brain needs time to adjust to the new way of living. It does seem dull in the beginning, your brain rarely produces the same amount of feel good-chemicals as a drug does, so of course it will seem dull in comparison. But as that lifestyle fades away and your brain gets used to the new ranges of ups and downs, it will adjust. Getting sober isn't just about not being on drugs, it's about building a new life and that, my friend, is hard and takes time. Your brain needs to heal and find its way in this new way of living. I recommend therapy, of course. For me, time has done alot and I'm still unfolding and discovering new parts if myself. I have recently started to cry again, which is something I appreciate. And I've come to find a lot of satisfaction in just maintaning routines and taking care of myself and my home. So my recommendation, besides therapy, would be to focus on who you are, how you would like your life to be and how you can get those two to work together.

jqimr3h,"A lot of this may be about where you are. Some groups suck. Some groups are great. This is a culture problem, which means how you should react to it depends on the existence or lack of existence of alternative groups in your area. None of the problems you’re describing are about the steps themselves. In fact, the 12 and 12 mentions this very issue. I recommend reading through it. There’s a section on “bleeding deacons” in one of the traditions. It sounds like you’re having trouble with them in your meetings. My suggestion is to find more tolerant culture around you if possible. If not, do your best to create it where you are. If they’re following the traditions (though it sounds like they’re not), they can’t kick you out for promoting a healthier view of recovery and the steps within your meetings. If you can’t find a more tolerant culture around you, I would explore Zoom meetings. To create the fellowship you crave (shift the culture), you can sponsor other people more appropriately, found your own meetings or push back on toxicity within the meetings you already attend by voicing your opinion. It’s very tempting to bail on meetings when this happens, but, in my opinion, members of 12 step programs owe it to the people after them to make a space where real recovery is available.

jqerdyh,"Everyone has a different definition of “recovery.” Some people will tell you taking Adderall as prescribed is not recovery. Some people will say taking any medication for mental health as prescribed is not recovery. The truth is- recovery is not a one-way road, your recovery won’t look like my recovery. To me, recovery means actively & progressively recovering from addiction & all the things that came with it in the healthiest way that works best for you. Personally, I have to take my mental health meds. In fact, I did a terrible job of taking them regularly/as recommended when I was in active addiction & only began to take them consistently when I began my recovery, as a part of my recovery & taking better care of myself. Adderall is one of my prescribed medications, & yes, I still take it in recovery. Yes, I still consider myself sober, I only take it as needed, as prescribed by my professional psychiatrist (who knows all about my substance abuse past) & I do not abuse it in any way. However, is it a risk? Sure. It definitely depends on your situation. Do you feel a little wary about taking Adderall? Are you afraid you’ll abuse it or become addicted, or that it will trigger you to use other substances? If yes, even a little bit, I would say it’s not a good idea. But if you feel that it genuinely wouldn’t trigger you in anyway & you feel that it would be more helpful than harmful to your well-being in the long-run, then I personally don’t see a problem with that. Ultimately it’s your decision, & with that time, that decision will reveal itself to be either helpful or harmful to you.",1688322304.0

jomrkl1,"With so many great comments, I’m not sure how much new I have to add, but I have both mental illness (BP1) and Substance Use Disorder (addiction) also known as Dual Diagnosis, so maybe I can offer a fresh perspective. First, your love and concern for him is obvious from your post. It’s clear how deeply you care about him. In my personal experience, in which I quit without a 12-Step program, I had to actively hate the drugs to stay clean. I wouldn’t allow myself to miss them or think about how great that life was because 1) those are lies, it’s not a great life living fix to fix and wondering where the next one was coming from, and 2) if I thought about how great they were it would have led me right back to using. I believe for your boyfriend to stay clean and truly recover he needs a paradigm shift from how he’s missing out by not having the drugs to how much better his life is because he doesn’t have drugs in it. I believe I saw mentioned in one of the previous comments that it’s recommended not to start a new relationship until you have at least a year of clean time. You have to be able to love yourself before you can truly love someone else, and that loving yourself takes time after addiction. So while I don’t doubt that he genuinely cares for you, I question whether he is emotionally capable of giving you true love at this point in his sobriety. Relapses happen. They happen a lot and they happen to most people. There are some lucky ones who are able to quit long term their first try, but most of us I think it takes a few times. I have never seen statistics on this but I suspect the rate of relapse is higher the younger someone is when they quit. I suspect there is a certain emotional maturity required to really want to quit instead of quitting for a specific reason like court. Unfortunately, relapses can happen at any stage of recovery so you never get to a point where you’re immune to it. If your stability rides on his sobriety, your mental health will never be safe. For this relationship to work you would have to develop the mental fortitude to withstand the chaos that him using would bring on both your lives. Easier said than done. To answer your questions: I don’t know if it’s normal but it’s not healthy; yes, I think it’s highly likely that he’ll relapse; and, for your own sake, I think you should end it. Having said that, you should probably know up front that it’s very likely that he will use you breaking things off with him as his excuse to relapse. It’s not your fault. He is responsible for his sobriety, not you. Do not carry any guilt for what he does after you end it. That’s all on him.",1687124027.0

Dopamine works the same way. You can't do things that give you big instant spikes if you want to appeciate the subtler things in life. 2.. It's terrible for your brain in the first place.

I started reading it during my next trauma response/emotional flashback a few weeks ago. And oh boy, have you sent me on a path there. I have started actively working on my underlying issues again, it's been so long. I had never received a diagnosis but it's obvious I'm a mess. Prolonged childhood trauma is the best explanation I have found so far. I wouldn't dare trying to diagnose myself, but I have since bought several more books on the subject and started reading the relevant subreddits. For the first time ever I'm getting the feeling that I'm close to something like an answer or even a solution. I've been doing this for so many years. First therapy was so long ago. It shaped me, but it didn't fix anything by itself. I am currently a little obsessed with finding out the truth. Certain memories have come back and suddenly been placed from the ""normal"" into the ""abuse"" territory. Shit's hard, you know what I'm talking about. But I think I might actually be able to walk this path. I am taking this so seriously, automatically, that some wild things have happened already. Right now I'm 5 days off weed, even though I even got more 2 days ago. I haven't touched the weed I have yet, and it's been relatively easy. That's not just new, that's basically insane compared to what's normal for me. But the biggest thing is that I have started seeing a new therapist. It's overdue, but with this new information, I finally have a goal, something to work on. Oh fuck, I never called it a goal before, no wonder I'm obsessed. Haven't had one in 3 years (the entire speed abuse phase). What I'm trying to say is: THANK YOU SO FUCKING MUCH!!! What you have given me with your comment is impossible to put into words. This is the first real, legitimate, hardcore progress I'm making on my mental health issues. I spent many years fixing the outside while trying to progress as well as I can on the inside on my own. Trying to get over the default ""it wasn't that bad"" mindset has been hard, but accepting that what happened to me was traumatizing has been freeing like almost nothing before. I always knew that my father ruined my life. Now I know that both my parents are to blame (and aren't, of course, because they were formed by their parents, just like me).

My motivation was adhering to a strict TRE time restricted eating window with 14-16hrs of fasting daily. Caffeine consumption was breaking those fasts. Anyway i use caffeine now a days as i prefer to. I usually consume a 100mg capsule of powder after my morning workout and I'm not a slave to caffeine. Many days that's it, some days i have espresso as well. Caffeine consumption is perfectly fine in moderation. Lowering tolerance was key for me. High caffeine equals anxiety. What i liked about being caffeine free was feeling calmer, more relaxed. I would feel tired more frequently though, and nap after meals some days, but my sleep may not have been as good as it is now. (Sleep is underrated). The thing i thought i was fixing by being without caffeine actually ended up being my attention span and didn't change by removing caffeine.

So I did petty, selfish, manipulative things to try to feel less angry - cheating, people pleasing, being dishonest with myself about my wants/needs. When I got sober, I felt super angry out of nowhere. Through therapy, step work, talking to sober people with more time than me, I realized that anger is an okay emotion PROVIDED I deal with it. So I think the book is saying more - you can’t stay angry and feel better. I think it goes with what both books (BB & 12&12) say about resentments. What I’ve heard in the rooms and relate to is that having a huge emotional reaction — which for me is often self-righteous anger, which comes before realizing I’m hurt — is a risk to my happiness. I hope no one in your meetings is telling you that step work will “fix” the trauma of your past. I attend a lot of online meetings so if your area’s in-person meetings are full of untherapied old timers who are telling you harmful stuff, I hope you’ll consider online meetings.

jih529i,"Wait does she have you blocked or not? If she has you blocked, then you should just move on. The point of an amends is to do something to make up for your wrong doing, usually to another person; if she doesn't want to talk to you, then the best thing you can do is leave her alone. If she did add you, and you aren't blocked still, then I would consider messaging her and apologizing, but only if she did just add you back and you're still unblocked. If she just blocked you again, it seems pretty clear that she doesn't want anything to do with you, and the best thing you can do is leave her alone. How long do you have clean? is your life back together, do you have sustained sobriety and have you handled all of your simpler amends already? These are all questions I would be asking myself to make sure I""m being honest about my motivations in this situation. And finally, the concept of amends in regards to recovery was created as part of the Alcoholics Anonymous program and has spread to other 12 Step Programs, like Narcotics Anonymous, and generally amends are done in the context of having completed the previous 8 steps with a sponsor who oversees the entire process for you, to ensure you don't do more damage than you've already done. If you're actually interested in a proper amends, the right way, for unselfish reasons, I would really recommend going to AA/NA, getting a sponsor, working through the steps, and when you get to Step 8, make a list of ALL the people you have harmed and make amends to all of them as it's intended in the program.",1682972424.0

jiclp8m,"Nothing is one with you, save for the fact you're not ""finished"". The fact you took drugs again means that you never stopped believing that the drugs were telling you the truth - that they really were ""good"" but that there was some other reason outside of the drugs that meant you couldn't participate. Well, that belief is wrong - the things you believe about the drugs were not true. The fun you thought you had on drugs was not real: it was a symptom caused by the interaction between the drug and your brain. For as long as you continue to believe the drug actually did the things you felt it did, you will be vulnerable to relapse - this doesn't reflect the reality of what makes drugs addictive. Be forgiving of yourself - even NA gets this completely wrong. 12-step groups will tell you that you are the problem, that you have a spiritual disease, and that you are different to normal people: none of this is true. Drugs are poisonous to everyone - everyone who consumes them suffers for it, addicts are merely those who've begun to do something about it. You're probably open to new approaches at this point - if you haven't already, I'd recommend starting your new phase of recovery by reading Annie Grace's books (Naked Mind is probably the ideal one for you).

jhz8f4h,"Well since alcohol is your DOC, that does make things a little harder. I would definitely rule out any of the classical drugs like opiates, cocaine, or meth/amphetamine, those drugs will ruin you a lot quicker than alcohol will. Since you're an alcoholic, it's really doubtful that you'll ever be able to drink normally. Best case scenario for you would likely be, being able to be around regular people, doing regular things, and drinking non-alcoholic drinks instead. Meetings aren't really a hobby, and that's likely a big reason as to why you're feeling so constricted by your recovery at the moment; you've \got\ to invest in things you love to do, maybe find new hobbies to supplement what you already do? Honestly I feel like people who use meetings as a source of entertainment are doing the whole thing wrong, meetings should be like a chore when we use them, a thing we use like therapy, and people who get a lot of their social interaction from meetings struggle, I've been there before. Stand up comedy and exercise are solid hobbies, but if you are getting into exercise, I'd really recommend getting into a form of it that you truly enjoy, otherwise it's more of a chore than a hobby, and you likely won't stick to it; I love bodybuilding and I literally get frustrated when I don't go when I'm hitting it really hard, it literally makes my day ever time I do it. Some people enjoy cardio like that, but most don't; I really recommend trying weightlifting, especially bodybuilding, as most of us are exercising to look good anyways, and bodybuilding does that better than anything, and it still does all the other stuff, like strength and health, just as well as anything else. Another thing you can do for fun is just simple stuff like going to the beach, going to see movies in theaters, going to comedy shows(!), anything like that :) Obviously you have to find people to do that stuff with, but that's the type of thing that just happens naturally at work, at your comedy shows, at the gym, at meetings, or wherever. And you were asking me about drugs... so I will say that psychedelics like LSD and Shrooms are totally non-addictive, and while MDMA(Ecstasy) could hypothetically be addictive, it can't be used every day because it stops working completely after the 2nd day of use, meaning you really can't abuse it like other drugs. Those are all relatively soft core drugs, like softer than alcohol IME, There are other drugs in the Tryptamine/Phenethylamine class that are also basically non-addictive that social circles revolve around, think people that go to festivals like Burning Man or raves, but you'd find out about all those later if you found out you liked tripping. What's your love life like? While romance isn't a substitute for a hobby, I found that I used to feel like I was missing out on life majorly because I was spending a lot of my free time going to meetings or hanging out with people at meetings, and meetings are literally the worst place you could ever meet someone. If you're in a good place as far as your physical appearance and confidence, emotionally/mentally, and financially, I'd definitely recommend you find some normies to start dating once you get your hobby situation figured out(so you don't become clingy), and online dating is a great way to meet new people, maybe even someone special, and that can effectively double your social circle.",1682633842.0

It sounds like you've got everything you need to make a long-term success out of this, but don't take your foot off the pedal. Keep looking for ways to grow and heal whatever stuff you have been held back by in life internally. To your questions. Start building new friendships.

jhgfufi,"I'd recommend going to NA. Alcohol has exactly the same mechanism of addiction as every other drug - the forced release of dopamine. Sure, the primary effect of alcohol, the effect you feel, might be somewhat ""opposite"" to a stimulant, but the secondary dopaminergic effect that causes you to form whatever beliefs are necessary to justify more use: that's exactly the same between both drugs, and it is this effect that makes drugs addictive. All 12-step literature gets this wrong - it claims the reason you can't trade one for another is that you have some kind of spiritual problem. You do not have a spiritual problem: the drugs inherently have this effect, and they have it on everyone who consumes them (not just ""addicts""). Every single person who drinks alcohol is poisoned and harmed by it - they are all doing it due to the illusion the drug's secondary effects create. Not a single human being has ever needed alcohol to have fun (in fact almost everything that is anathema to having fun that you see in public is driven by alcohol), yet billions have believed they do under its influence. But as far as 12-step literature goes, NA's literature has the advantage of recognizing that alcohol isn't a special case. AA almost embodies the idea that alcohol represents a special case when it does not - under-the-hood, it's doing exactly what every other addictive drug on earth is doing, so if you must use a 12-step program, use the one that correctly identifies that and states it in its opening pages (and most fellowships will restate it at the start of each meeting).",1682293371.0

jhc3i19,"For me, an important part of recovery was recognising that depression is far more often a feature than a bug: low feelings represent low judgments about the world. Mood-stabilizing medication has the same drawback as blood-pressure medication: sure, it can alleviate your symptoms (although the degree to which SSRIs actually achieve that is debatable _HYPERLINK_ but as those symptoms indicate a problem it can also make you pursue a course of action that your body is trying to warn you away from. Unpleasant mental states exist to alert us to unpleasant situations. They compel us to change our circumstances. Just as people who take blood pressure medication but make no lifestyle changes can become far more obese before they have to deal with it, people who take SSRIs can persist with irrational beliefs for far longer than they might otherwise have before they start to look at change. Onto practicals - I took an amount of molly that would blow your mind for about 3 years in my early 20s. About a gram a day from the ages of 23-26, which I only stopped after the brain zaps that left me incapacitated became hourly. As you're probably aware, this is many tens of times the ""very neurotoxic"" dose of molly. Even having used that much for that long, I went back to normal. It wasn't until many years later when I stopped all the other drugs I was taking too, but even with all that molly then a bunch on top, my brain is now back to working very well. In the course of all that I did learn that the medical establishment is often the friend of psychiatric condition ""symptom management"" but the enemy of psychiatric ""cure"" - I did cut out all of the SSRIs, antipsychotics, barbituates, anxiolytics, and other things I had been taking and pursued the theory that all of my emotions were the result of beliefs and that I could be happy by taking negative ones as a sign of beliefs that needed changing. These beliefs are roughly compatible with Individual Psychology and Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy if you want to look into them. That did work - it sounds like you're starting to suspect that drugs might not be right for you too. It would not surprise me if you were right - I would recommend continuing along the lines you're already on and going to the theory that your negative mood is not the result of molly or some kind of biological, inherited ""depression"", but simply your body indicating to you that something about your life is unsatisfactory, and that practical change (both internal and external) is required. I never saw a person operating on that theory who wasn't well for it, whereas I've seen scores of people sucking down SSRIs yet still being miserable (and precisely ""0"" people for whom they amounted to a cure).",1682209695.0
jhbu012,">What is happening to me? Is this normal? The question ""is this normal"" is never a very useful one - most people are never drug addicts, and even most drug addicts are never held captive, beaten mostly to death, and forced to commit crimes under the threat of murder. So what would the question ""is this normal"" mean in this context? It isn't normal for people to experience what you experienced: if it was we'd live in literal hell. If you mean ""is it normal for people who've experienced the type of things I've experienced to have nightmares"", then yes it is normal on two levels:  People who are using drugs are induced to believe things that are consistent with drug use whilst they're still using. This means they can be in horrifying situations and yet not perceive them to be horrifying, because the drug has caused them to adopt beliefs that suggest the situation is acceptable because that's what makes drugs addictive. So it's normal for you to have been ""fine"" then but to have experienced increasing psychological distress as your beliefs returned to normal: now, with your normal beliefs, you perceive what you went through as horrifying and are experiencing the emotions consistent with that new belief.  People who've had their lives threatened and been forced to endure long periods of having no apparent self-determination do often develop extreme psychological conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder. You are probably experiencing both of these - you're having a normal post-traumatic stress reaction to your life being threatened, but that reaction is delayed for the ""normal"" reason that drug addicts experience a lag between ceasing drug use and experiencing a shift towards interpreting their past as deeply unpleasant. At the very least, it's time to start reading books on recovery from addiction. I have to advise that you don't just turn to 12-step literature: it is a very poor source of psychological truth or comprehension of how drugs influence the mind (the 12-steps will completely dismiss the idea drugs influence the mind at all, and suggest it is simply the addict's own broken spirit causing their addiction, which is about as grotesquely false as any claim about drugs can be). If you intend to use 12-step literature, use it in conjunction with scientific material. I found the book ""Molecule of More"" which isn't even about addiction but is about the role of dopamine in the human body is very illuminating, and the book ""The Courage to be Disliked"" (misleading title) was my first post-sobriety read that really got me thinking in a fundamentally different way, but I'd recommend you find your own.

However, the biggest caution that I would give my patients is based on how it works: it's an opiate blocker. That means in the slim chance you were to ever need opiates for pain control (ER or surgery, dentist, etc), you would need a crazy amount of an opiate dose to overcome the naltrexone.

jevoyfl,"Best thing for you to do is to let the dentist know what’s going on with you… and based upon what the circumstances are with your your specific procedure and current medications they’ll be able to prescribe something that should make the pain manageable. I had mine out about 8 years ago, and the dentist had a particularly difficult time with removing my wisdom teeth. Even knowing my history, due to the complications, I was prescribed a prescription strength Naproxen and a script for a controlled substance painkiller… just in case. I filled the Naproxen immediately and gave the other script to my wife in case it was needed. I didn’t really have any significant pain while on the Naproxen, so I never had the other one filled, but the option was there… and the plan was for her to dispense it as prescribed if it had come to that. I recently have had surgeries since that required heavier painkillers… and those do tend to play with my mind a bit. Even with 13 years substance-free, and definitely not getting “high” (at least by my old standards) on the recommended dosages… I felt a bit of a euphoric side effect, and thus a certain sadness when they ran out. I also found I was a bit “off” for a few days after (irritable, amorphous cravings), so it’s still playing with fire for me.

je0hpk1,"I struggle with this, but the times when I have had the most peace and happiness has been when I have surrendered and believed that there is something benevolent bigger than me that gives me better guidance than my own thoughts do. After starting Adult Children of Alcoholics 2 years ago, I now think that the power in ""surrendering"" and ""trusting a higher power"" is mostly this: your own biochemistry (addictive) and/or trauma-informed thinking lead you to addictive behavior that hurts you and others. Turning your life over to a HP, relying on a HP, surrendering to a HP: all are ways of urging people to listen to something other than their own thoughts/desires. A long time ago, in AA meetings they used to say you can choose any higher power you want, even a doorknob. It sounds nonsensical, but it gets across the idea that your own thoughts are leading you in the wrong direction and can't be fixed by doing more of your own thinking, and that your ""Higher Power"" doesn't have to be a traditional religious god of any sort. These days they recommend taking the group or people who have good recovery as a higher power. My dad got sober and had some years of amazing sobriety. I found a journal entry he wrote early on and it showed he was struggling with doing the right thing about a money issue. He wrote about what his AA sponsor and his sister advised and he did end up doing the right thing. It made me wonder if most people who are ""good"" are not doing it all by themselves.

jdtq2o7,"Well as far as Narcotics Anonymous/Alcoholics Anonymous are concerned, you just completed the first step, so I'd say you're on the right track :) ""We admitted we were powerless over drugs, that our lives had become unmanageable"" The next step, in my opinion, is for you to connect your addiction, and by proxy recovery, to the rest of the people in your life. This means telling all of the people who you love and who are close to you IE: your parents, close family members, best friends, etc. It's painful but this will allow them into your life and give you real accountability, while also keeping the reality of your addiction from being pushed down and forgotten the next time getting high sounds nice. Then, I would recommend looking into treatment. I don't know your situation but most of the time,, if you just tell an employer that you are having a medical emergency and that you need some time off, while giving proper notice ie 2 weeks, they will be fine with it. The main thing is that you need to interrupt the process of addiction immediately. See I've struggled with addiction for like twelve years, and the way it works is like this: imagine there's a big line, right? We all start off on one side of the line, but the more and more we abuse drugs and change our brain chemistry, we get closer and closer to crossing over to the other side. Once we cross over to the other side of the line, we can keep on going further in the same direction, but we can never cross back to the other side of the line again. That line is addiction, in that, once we cross the line of addiction, most people will never be able to shake addiction for the rest of our lives. To me, it sounds like you haven't crossed that line yet, so there's a chance this might not be a thing you struggle with for the rest of your life yet, but I'd recommend you do whatever is necessary to interrupt this process so you don't end up with a permanent monkey on your back.",1679885669.0

jdczj13,"Medicating so that we ""feel better"" doesn't make our problems any less present. On the contrary, our problems will certainly increase as we escalate our drug use. Many times, doing so can cause irreparable damage to our situation and our relationships. Eventually, our DOC will no longer be effective, and no matter how much of it we have access to, it will never be enough. The time will come when we are FORCED to stop using, many times not by choice, but by circumstance. Looking back from a point like this in one's life, I don't know a single person who has been where you are now who would say they they don't regret returning to drug use when they had this disease in remission. Problems are now compounded and magnified; many times in the absence of relationships our choices have now destroyed, and we STILL have to stop using our DOC because it doesn't work anymore. You have been able to stay clean, and that is commendable. It isn't enough, however, because you haven't been able to achieve peace with contentment. It's so important that you seek that out and work towards it. It won't fall into your lap. It takes work and determination to find out who we really are and mold that person into who we will become. It's a process to become the best version of ourselves. This doesn't get easier as we age. Trust me, I am speaking to you from experience. All that returning to drug use would achieve is complicating your situation and adding insult to injury. You have an amazing start. Seek out others who have been where you have come from and have overcome their obstacles; people who you can see have achieved in their character the things you're looking for in yourself. You will never get to where you wanna be if you give up. Make a plan for yourself, put your head down, and go forward. You can DO THIS. What one man can do? So can another. It's your turn.

Anyway, I went to rehab, which was 12 step based. I was desperate, and willing to do whatever was suggested by my counselors. part of my treatment required to attend, three meetings a week, which I did. While I have a lot of qualms with the program, it was ultimately very helpful for me. And I attribute that to the other people in The Rooms. meetings were a place I could go sit amongst people who really understood the insanity of my brain, and who didn’t judge me for it. Also, with all the sobriety in the rooms, it made the idea of me getting sober seem possible. It’s really helpful to be around people with similar goals, especially if that goal means staying sober. If you haven’t already, I would suggest checking out some 12 step meetings, AA or NA--I prefer AA because I find there’s more sobriety in the rooms and the energy is a little less intense. But it’s really about finding people you’re comfortable sharing around and maybe even befriending or acquainting yourself with so that you have someone you can reach out to win the little gremlin starts whispering in your ear. there are also other groups that focus on maintaining sobriety that are not 12 step based. SMART, Dharma... You’re young, and you would be surprised at how many young people are in your shoes. They do have specific meetings for young people in AA/NA. I guess kind of the message I’m trying to get across here is don’t let the idea of “higher power"" put you off from checking out a meeting, you might find that very useful. Also, I highly recommend checking out the audiobook recovering I highly recommend checking out the audiobook recovering. It’s by Russell Brand, who I understand some people feel has gone too far in his ideologies, but he is a recovering addict, who has successfully maintain sobriety for over a decade, and he does an incredible job in this book of distilling the big book of Alcoholics Anonymous and making it more palatable if you're off-put by the idea of God/higher power. it’s a more eastern approach. as someone who began using in my youth and didn’t get sober until I was 35, I recommend that if you spot a problem now, it’s easier to address before it gets out of hand, which it will: it’s just a matter of how long it takes you to descend to the depths of a hell that makes you want to recover.",1677864832.0

But the most important thing is now that you're ending all the toxic relationships that have kept you sick, you need to start new relationships that are healthy. If you just leave a big empty space in your life and you have no positive relationships, eventually the loneliness will get so bad that you'll relapse and go back to toxic relationships, because nobody can bare to be alone. I recommend going to Narcotics Anonymous to find friends that are healthy.

ja29kcp,"Haha I went to rehab at 20 too. It was a great decision and I went in kicking and screaming so you are in a better mental place than I was. I thought I was going home to detox but that’s another story for another day. Rehab is great and opens your eyes to sobriety. I ended up going back to school and relapsing, then constantly relapsing throughout my adult life. Sometimes I’d be clean for a year or two but I would relapse a lot, sometimes it was only a day or week. I’m 32 now, don’t be like me. It’s a lonely and treacherous road to walk and I am very lucky to be surrounded by wonderful people and have resources to deal with addiction. Not everyone is so fortunate. My school was very accommodating and let me finish my classes remotely even before remote was a thing 2010-11. You have the chance to nip this now. It won’t get better. You won’t magically learn how to control it, or be mature enough, or rich enough, or established enough, or whatever enough. Everyone was very supportive of me. I still have a lot of friends from college but we have drifted apart. The life either takes you away from them or they don’t want to see you ruin your life. Being around someone and watching them nod or be fucked up is traumatizing for people. Don’t put your loved ones through this. I’d honestly recommend sober living for like 3 months after rehab also. I did an IOP also. The more time you can get under your belt the better chance you have. It’s hard to go back to college where you are surrounded by partying. You may not want to quit anything else but one drug, and that’s fine, but it puts you at greater risk. It will be difficult to go back to that environment and stay clean but not impossible. I wouldn’t really recommend it but I understand not wanting to transfer or do something different. Also, what I struggled with a lot and couldn’t see at your age was that I didn’t have a drug problem so much, I had personal problems and poor coping skills and they resulted in drug addiction. Your life won’t just magically improve once the drugs are removed you are going to have to figure out how to conceptualize and think differently and change your perspective. It’s a net positive for you but it isn’t easy and takes a lot of work. The good news is that you can catch up and you can get started immediately, bad news is that it’s hard work especially building the habits at first. I feel for you which is why this is so long. Rehab was a formative experience for me at 20 and I wish you the best of luck",1677399765.0
j9dxx18,"this. a million times the first paragraph. benzodiazepines and alcohol are also the two things that can kill you if you stop them suddenly if your body is dependent on them. i think if he is doing both of these things regularly for any extended period of time — he definitely needs medical supervision to get off of them. i will also say he will probably need medical supervision ANYWAY due to the fact that he’s in a very fragile state and you have to be PREPARED for getting off benzodiazepines. if he’s feeling this way TAKING them; i cannot imagine getting off them suddenly is going to put him in a better mindset. all in all, suicide is VERY serious and is cause for immediate action. i say change your flight and show up. what’s the worst thing that happens if you do? he gets angry at you and you have to get a hotel? the worst that can happen if you DON’T go is far, far worse. if he’s been telling his (ex) girlfriend about doing it - it should be taken seriously. any threat should be taken seriously - EVEN if they are just saying it to scare others or illicit a response from them. go ahead and change your flight. that’s what i would do. also; DO keep calling and try to find a treatment place for him ~ or even a rehab. TRY to get him to go… perhaps come together with his ex and whoever else if you have to and try to get him to go. i know a lot of times, this does backfire and the person gets angry and pushes people away… but it doesn’t have to be aggressive, and shouldn’t be. just do your best to surround him with tons of love right now and lift him up. i would also recommend taking others’ advice if he is against all of it - and having him baker acted or whatever. because he’s made the threat to LITERALLY anyone at all; then he is considered a threat to himself. good luck. <3 my inbox is always open if you need to talk or need advice.",1676957076.0

j93r4th,"All the more reason to get into treatment. Fentanyl is making into all kinds of street drugs in the US, and gambling with an OD every time you're trying to score is dangerous. Buprenorphine will have a higher affinity than all other opioids, so you should have no major opioid withdrawal symptoms when you transition/get inducted under the care of a physician. Frequent yawning, runny eyes, goose bumps, low energy are all early opioid withdrawal symptoms, followed by the rest of the terrible stuff. Cramps, restless leg syndrome, anxiety, muscle aches and spasms, and that ""holy crap im dying"" feeling. You dont really need to know what you've been taking, if its in the opioid family, buprenorphine (suboxone) will take care of the withdrawals, plus has the benefit of making it hard to get high from other opioids. Although i highly recommend buying all in to treatment. Counseling, and support from close friends and family, and whatever else you need to get into and stay in active recovery.

When we’re addicted, we become isolated and sever all of our human connections which really puts us into a position where quitting becomes even harder. You really need human connection with people who can lead you on the right path and support you when you need it.

I highly recommend checking out some of the other recovery supports out there that are alternatives to 12 steps-- SMART recovery, She Recovers, Recovery Dharma, Buddhist Recovery network, etc. Personally to feel less empty, I had to find new healthy things and people to fill the void, but also had to majorly change how I was thinking about my addiction. Thinking that you're left out, missing something, or ""can't"" do what the others are doing, is a recipe for relapse. SMART recovery was especially helpful with me changing my mindset and how I viewed drugs and alcohol. It is based in Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy and addresses addiction from the standpoint of our thoughts and behaviors. But no matter how you're recovering, feeling whole again is something that takes time. I'm now 6 years free from alcohol and 15 years from drugs.

k7ggvzt,"So I think it’s really cool that you’re asking questions about the structure of the meeting and whether it works not just for you but everyone else in the room. I’m assuming you’ve not yet become involved enough in your meetings to engage in the Business/ steering meeting side of things. If you have, you’ll know that the script of the meeting is agreed upon by the group itself, ie those who do the service needed to keep the meeting running. There’s no set script handed down from on high that every meeting needs to follow- every group can write their own script and vote on what needs to be said and what doesn’t. If the group gets together and votes that every week the meeting should start with the speaker talking for three minutes about their favourite pizza topping before expressing three things they’re grateful for via the medium of interpretive dance, then that’s what the script will say until someone suggests that is of questionable use to the newcomer and puts a new script to the group. What I’m saying is- if the script seems overly filled with information that seems of dubious utility to you, you have the power to suggest that is changed. That’s one of the beauties of 12 step recovery- you can be as involved as you like, but if something is annoying you, or you think it’s pointless, you can say so in the business meeting and suggest that it’s changed. If your suggestion does not pass the group vote, you can a) stay and suck it up, safe in the knowledge that you had your say and your voice was heard, b) stay and get super resentful because why does no one ever listen to you and what you need and feel, or c) start another group where you write the script and do things your own way.

k09vxgk,"So there’s a concept called PAWS, Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome, which is characterized by several specific behaviors or responses physically and mentally. It is suggested that there might be some connection to the timing of the lunar clock, which I literally rolled my eyes in skepticism, yet I have found mostly useful for paying attention to my own behaviors. That is the whole issue anyway, isn’t it? That I get fixed on some idea and then stop paying attention to whether what I am doing is right or wrong. So whether the moon phases time well with these symptoms or not, you can use it as a system for collecting data. Basically, you are a creature of habit. The stimuli that make you do things is important and you must document to isolate which stimuli makes you behave in which way. Some of these stimuli might just be that about six months ago, you stopped doing meth and now every time you ABC then XYZ results happen. For instance, you are tired, you say something shitty to someone rather than walking away. You let your sleep deprivation prevent you from not being a shit. This is your fault. So you can eventually isolate that if you just go to be at the right time, and wake up rested, you end up using way less time on useless drama. Well, the same thing is true about our clocks. How many nights did you stay up and party? How many times at exactly 2:37AM did you happen to be vomiting? Do you think we can pair our internal clocks with these experiences? You bet your ass we do.

And do not under any circumstances stop cold turkey. A taper is highly suggested if given a choice because you can run into seizures and several other withdrawal symptoms. The best thing to do is go and get guidance under a medical professional. I'm personally self tapering because the length of time that I've been prescribed does not fit the criteria of the Ashton manual which suggests you decrease your dose 1/4 of a milligram every 2 weeks and that's just too fast for my gaba receptors to heal. Insomnia is going to be a given. Also extreme agitation and possibly mood swings from anger to sadness to despair. If I were you I would join or get your friend to join r/benzorecovery.

They all will give referrals and I think most of that is legit, like suggesting an IOP or sober living. But if they're overly forceful about the exact one, that causes alarm. For instance, I wanted to come back home for IOP from Florida but they really tried getting me into their IOP in Florida and I to a specific network of halfway houses. Yes, the argument could be made they wanted to watch my downgraded care plan, but for me, being back home was in many ways healthier than staying in Florida. The hard sell was just sour tasting.

jydts8e,"Here’s how SAMHSA defines Recovery. Recovery is: “A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life, and strive to reach their full potential” If this is what you want, then there are answers to your question. However, they require you to have an open mind and enough humility to acknowledge that you may not know everything you need. The way to get your brain to function as it did is to understand what you’ve done to your brain, to be patient, get proper sleep, nutrition, hydration, exercise, social activities, and therapy. Understand that you’ve fucked your brain chemistry, but it’s not permanent. You’ve desensitized your brain to dopamine, so the pre-cocaine levels of dopamine don’t feel like anything. Patience and doing the other things will fix this. The typical addictive type of “all or none”, “I want it NOW”, “If I do more I’ll get results faster” thinking is not what you need. You want to create a Long Term Sustainable Lifestyle rather than overdoing it. Have a look at your 5x week kickboxing schedule and think about that. I saw someone suggest therapy and your rejection of the idea. Having some humility will serve you here. You say you know why you’re depressed, and you might be right. You also might be very, tragically wrong. Many addicts have mental/behavioral health issues prior to ever picking up. In fact, those people are self medicating their undiagnosed issues with the wrong drugs. For example, many alcoholics treat their preexisting depression with a depressant drug, namely alcohol. Many of the few addicts without prior mental/behavioral health issues get them from living their life as an addict. Most people get to have BOTH scenarios simultaneously. So you’ve told doctors (therapists) things before, great - maybe it’s time to tell a therapist things you’ve told no one before. If you’ve suffered Trauma, you will not get better until you deal with it with a trained professional. Trauma will not be suppressed or ignored - it lives in your muscles as well as your mind. “The Body Keeps The Score” is a great book about Trauma if you’d like to educate yourself on the subject.

Until they’re bumming or buying cigarettes. (No vapes allowed)The staff should keep this for him and give him a pack when he asks. Foam type ear plugs will make life much easier.

Other cities, you can sometimes just go into the ER and they will admit him. Methadone should have been decreased gradually, it's concerning that he just quit it cold turkey. He needs to be working with a doctor on these decisions moving forward. Depending on what insurance he has, an inpatient rehab might be an option as well to get him stable and treatment to maintain his sobriety. Relapses can happen to anyone, that doesn't mean he ""doesn't care"" or ""doesn't want to get sober"" as some of these comments suggest. Set boundaries for yourself, set clear expectations for him about what he needs to do if you are going to entertain the idea of a relationship moving forward, but you can also be supportive of his recovery. I'd say if he isn't willing to take steps towards recovery or try the solutions you offer, then it's time to move on.

By the end of the school year three of the girls at my school had committed suicide, so the school had to launch an investigation as to what could possibly be happening. They found out that this one guy had been blackmailing all these girls and they found his hard drive that contained thousands of pics from hundreds of girls at our school and surrounding areas. Of course this has now turned into multiple serious crimes and he ended up going to jail and is now a sex offender.

jrktt4c,"There are no rules. Only suggestions, so you can do whatever you want. That said, there are good reasons why they suggest same-sex sponsors for hetero peeps. The sponsor/sponsee relationship can end up being an incredibly intimate one. You'll be extremely vulnerable, and while sharing very personal information with a compassionate listener who has your back, it's not unheard of for either or both people to catch feelings. Have you ever heard a married person saying they had ""An Emotional Affair?"" This relationship has the potential to be an emotional affair on steroids, which can easily turn physical. Then there's the proximity factor. People you like tend to become or seem more attractive when they spend significant time together. This is seen in relationships that begin in a work environment where people feel the way you do now about the other person. This doesn't necessarily mean you can't work with this person. However, it makes sense to consider the potential downsides for you and them to see if you think you should.",1689105626.0

As long as you’re fully honest with a competent doctor, doing what they suggest is not a relapse and doesn’t threaten your sobriety. Take the meds prescribed as prescribed, and you’re good to go.

The fellowship loves nothing more than to pretend they’re the alpha and omega of the suggested program of recovery offered in AA but they are not. The twelve steps are the program, the literature accompanies the steps, the fellowship and meetings are where members go to share the message and do service. The fellowship is just the support group. The patients do not run the asylum and if they did, everyone would be dead. Your mental health and mental health treatment are your business, it has absolutely nothing to do with AA. They are not doctors, they are not professionals, commentary or suggestions on your medical care is off-program and egregiously irresponsible.

jqqtk6r,"Sorry for your troubles. The feelings of isolation and inadequacy are likely associated with using again. Something upsets us (or we are excited), we use/drink, that leaves us feeling worse than before, so now we feel the need to numb the pain/feel comfort again. It's the combination of shame + inconsistency that makes us want to keep using. Shame is what leads to relapse. Dont beat yourself up. Treat it like a fact and keep moving. I humbly suggest that none of your problems that you are dealing with will actually be improved by using or drinking. It makes them easier to deal with by not dealing with them. You are trying to get your brain and body to be in a healing state (that's what recovery is). The more time in that state, the more healed you'll be. The last few days of using havent been in a healing state so you havent made progress those days but you were making progress until then. And this setback is likely a huge reduction in what your usage. You used/drank a few times after six months? Compare thay to how you used last year. Or the year before. If it is a reduction then you are making progress. We want to be idealistic but that makes it a success vs failure, perfection vs progress thing. Thats the biggest flaw with counting only consecutive days in sobriety. You have made progress. Keep making progress. Keep going and take advantage of it. You arent starting from scratch.

jqkp9ou,"Coming up on 10 years here, and I agree 100% with this reply. AA zealots are to be avoided at all cost. One reason is, they have not fully absorbed the program. - AA is a program of attraction. - AA has no rules, just suggestions. - There is only 1 requirement for membership; a desire to stop drinking. In the words of the Big Book, these ""experts"" are continuing to ""play the Director"" in recovery, forcing their version of AA on newcomers. In fairness, their version of AA got them sober, and sobriety is so great, they are hellbent to sharing the gift, as they received it. What they fail to understand, ""yes, we're all the same down at the core, BUT, we are still unique around the edges."" Here's what I did early in my sobriety, I luckily identified a sponsor I could work with. (I will call him Bill.) That's not a typo, I needed a sponsor who would accept me for the crazy person I was, and then influence my thinking away from my unique brand of insanity. Bill was like a master fisherman, easing pressure on the line when needed, preventing me from breaking free and swimming away. Bill never told me what to do, he would ask things like, ""what meeting are you going to tonight"" or ""did you talk with anyone else today?"" Based on my answer, he'd offer up his opinion...""try not to slack off because...."" or ""Try calling Fred's a good guy, you should try calling him from time to time because..."" Bill also told me about the zealots. ""Listen buddy, AA is not a hotbed of sanity. We're all alcoholics with our own flavors of insanity. I am your sponsor, and I should be the only person you're listening to. If anyone tries telling you what to do, smile politely, thank them, and say 'Bill is my sponsor, I will discuss this topic with him.' If they persist, walk away. If that doesn't work, have them talk to me. In my view, sponsorship is not a group project."" I love Bill. PS: If you don't read carefully, I am not working MY program.

jqjgsqy,"When I first went to AA over 20 years ago, I fell in with Big Book thumpers. The good news: I extensively learned about the steps and AA history. The bad news: they had a dogmatic view of AA and recovery in general which infected me. I was an atheist coming in, but was told to “Get a god or you’re going to die” so I earnestly tried. In fact, I gave leads at conferences about “what god is doing for me today” and the like. I’m not slamming god at all here, only the toxic manipulators. One day after looking at the back of my 2 year coin and read “To thine own self be true”, I asked myself if I actually believed the things I was saying. I answered no and reprogrammed my thinking and attitude. This was challenging because I would have died if not for AA, so what if my new approach did t work? Well, it did. My new message was honest about my secular approach to AA, which I knew wasn’t “the message” my bb peeps wanted to hear. I eventually tired of dealing with the negative feedback and left AA at about 5 years. I’m not telling you what to do, or even suggesting. In fact, there are many elements of recovery and even my philosophy of life that I learned in AA. For example that serving others can leave a residue of happiness in its wake. If you can stay in AA and be happy, great. If that doesn’t work for you, great. You can explore other recovery groups or none at all. I would suggest having an honest look at what you’ve learned in AA that’s been beneficial and true for you. Then look at the negatives and see if you have a part in them and if there are alternatives - such as going to different meetings and getting a sponsor who understands that they don’t get a vote in how you do your recovery.

You hand me a card that states your name with a doctorate at the end, and you show up unprepared for a meeting you asked for? It was unreal. She then criticized our choice of treatment centers suggesting she had a golden list of vetted places. So I asked her to list the places. I then let her know I had called many of those and they refused to take my son due to his violent history with me, had no space, or most importantly my son would refuse their request for a psych exam which was a requirement of theirs. She then asked me to describe the violence he did to me. So I did, and she looked beyond shocked. I found the questioning inappropriate at best, harmful to me at worst.

jpowmuf,"Sorry for the delay my friend. Gate Control Therapy can take on two forms that I have experience with. I recall all the rage about T.E.N.S units if your familiar...the stimulation of a specific region or muscle (externally) via a small electrical current. Supposedly to begin a tense/relax rhythm to interrupt neuro pain signals from reaching the brain to be interpreted as such. I'm a layman, but that's my understanding and they never worked for me...perhaps I was just too far beyond that aiding me when I tried it. Now my pain ranges throughout my spine with exception of a couple of Thoracic vertebrae. As my lumbar/sacral region really deteriorated after my 4th surgery, I developed a unrelievable and maddening pain that shot from my rectum to the tip of my penis and usually occurred while attempting to stand after a seated position. It was so painful, I would literally scream in pain. Any way, The next surgery was to implant a neurostimulator with leads that were routed to the responsible vertebrae. Putting the electrical stimulation into the interior of my body unlike the external application of TENS units. Presto...with a few remote adjustments in strength and radius GONE like magic. Now Gate Control does not even need to require electricity and the theory is often compared to when one hits their knee and automatically begins to rub their knee for relief. It's suggested that we do this intuitively to ease the pain and somehow it does. The same theory is applied to physically tending to whatever area of your discomfort with your own hands. Now...its a theory and may be all psychological (placebo effect) that I experience. But I can find relief when standing and applying pressure and releasing...kind like some meditation practices where you tense a part of your body and then relax the same. So there ya go...If your pain is chronic and severe we can go on to my last surgery.

jobo1yk,"Check the selection criteria: ""We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi‐RCTs and non‐randomized studies that compared AA or TSF (AA/TSF) with other interventions, such as motivational enhancement therapy (MET) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), TSF treatment variants, or no treatment."" Notice these RCTs, quasi-RCTs, and non-randomized studies don't compare AA to other treatment modalities such as Smart Recovery nor to non-participants of the study which does not necessarily refute recent findings that most people tend to recover from addictive behaviors around their early thirties with no therapy or support group (would have to read more into the research paper to discern whether the participants with no treatment were assessed via studies using primarily RCTs, quasi-RCTs or non-randomized studies). Also it is well-known that both CBT and MET face serious limitations for treating problems involving addictions or dual-diagnoses, why were other treatment modalities such as DBT (much more effective for addiction as the benefits are more immediately apparent) or ACT (also more effective than CBT, MET in this respect) not included? It isn't reasonable from comparing these treatments alone to suggest that ""AA is more effective than therapy,"" it only indicates it's more effective than those two forms of treatment which doesn't surprise me at all as the overemphasis on CBT is one of my criticisms of Smart Recovery. Humphreys correctly states the most important factor of AA's effectiveness is its community support. For those who recover on their own without therapy or AA or otherwise, it is probably likely such people tend to have more community support already so they don't need support groups. There was nothing in the abstract that specified how any of the particular steps of the twelve steps were supported as causally efficacious in maintaining sobriety, except insofar as it can be inferred that attendance and adherence to the steps in accordance with AA guidelines or sometimes mandates is a requisite for reciprocation of continued community support within the program.",1686899657.0

jo9jfw5,"Where is the empirical evidence supporting efficacy of 12 steps? Supposedly there is plenty, but personally I doubt such studies were conducted with sound methodology. To my understanding AA has abysmally low success rates. I am bitter about the fact that rehabs and government programs are almost always entirely 12-step based focusing on a guilt/shame/moral inventory concept of treating addiction, when in almost any other aspect of psychological science it is well known that guilt and shame are not effective means of treating problems. Coffee is a drug. Sugar is a drug. Read Dr. Carl Hart's breakthrough research and personal experience with drugs and it is clear that most problems from drug use are not so much due to the drugs in themselves but are more related to other sociological factors such as poverty, stigmatization, lack of access to drugs in their pure forms which are far less dangerous than the adulterants mixed with them (heroin for instance is fairly safe in its pure form, and yes, there are people capable of using it in moderation, as Dr. Carl Hart shows), lack of meaningful work, and many other factors. Furthermore, suggesting that 12 steps is THE method of recovery impedes scientific research and fails to integrate new scientific findings about drug abuse. During AA's inception nearly all studies on drug addiction were based on studies (still widely and wrongly accepted today by governmental institutions such as the National Institute of Health) extrapolating from behavior of rats raised in isolated cages; it is difficult enough to find reliable evidence about human behavior based on observing behavior of rats, and impossibly difficult when placing rodents in isolated, solitary, unnatural environments. Bill W. is not God. He was someone who took acid and believed in the potential for psychedelics to invoke spiritual experiences to inspire someone towards sobriety through a commitment to spirituality (and I believe there may be some merit there.) I doubt he intended his program to remain immune from criticism as it so often is in practice today. I have to wonder if I would have ever ended up so addicted if I hadn't stepped foot in 12 step meetings after smoking weed and drinking a few times as a teenager. For me, this led to a self-fulfilling prophecy in which I was determined to hit ""rock bottom"" to rise like a phoenix from the ashes one day. Maybe this could have all been avoided if I only had a better understanding of drugs based on modern science that unfortunately is still not accepted by governing institutions responsible for the treatment/""recovery"" industry. I am not entirely bashing 12 steps either and don't deny it can be extremely helpful for many people. Nor do I think I am smarter than others because it hasn't worked for me. I just don't care to walk into a room and get a white chip and attend 90 meetings in 90 days ever again. The evidence shows most people recover on their own without outside treatment programs including AA.",1686858966.0
jo88m7e,"In my experience managing symptoms with substances (prescribed or not) after being physically addicted is impossible. It’s simply not a option anymore, over any period of time I will always progress towards abuse, which in turns worsens my symptoms, which in turn increases my abuse and round and round we go. If you’re off them now and are not in real medical danger, I would suggest you hang in there, it will get better over time if you try your very best to find other coping mechanisms. Mine consisted of all of the following combined meditation, exercise, 12 step meetings (the work that goes along with it), therapy, a healthy diet.

jo6bnux,"I'll probably be vilified for this but I did. However I used xanax when I didn't have opioids for legit back pain. And I was using RC benzos, never to get high but to stop spasms. Ended up taking heroic doses to feel normal. Went CT because I hated being a slave, and quit my job that week. I take .5mg of xanax maybe once every 2 weeks for sleep issues now or to relax after a hectic day of therapy. I wouldn't suggest anyone do it, I just know my body. If you were a textbook addict I would say never touch them again. By this I mean losing jobs because of it, forgetting important events, doing risky behavior you normally would never do, etc... vs a chemical dependency which is just you with a tolerance taking more and upping it as tolerance goes up, and then subsequently detoxing when you stop.

jnv5bq7,"Just follow me here. If you’re high you are not sober, you are at a sobriety meeting. People will have feelings on that and they wouldn’t be completely wrong or right, it really comes down to the person. Even though it’s not as harmful as many other things, weed is something people can be addicted to, just look at /r/leaves. People can be addicted to anything. The question is, is it a problem for you? You already know you are capable of having problems with addiction because you go to AA so really take time to examine if it’s something that is worth looking into. I’d suggest trying to get clean and see how it hits you, if it really is not a problem, it shouldn’t be difficult and it lets you evaluate if it’s something you should work on. At the end of the day you will decide to live your life the way you’d like and it sounds like you are already making great strides and progressing on changing things you knew were a problem and that’s awesome! Keep doing great on that. If weed ends up being difficult to put down for even a short time then focus on that as a project. If it’s really not an issue then do what you’d like to there is no need to address it. Don’t jeopardize your success in sobriety from alcohol, but if you end up feeling like weed is a necessity to be sober maybe it’s time to think about how or if you’d like to take a look at that. Either way, it can’t be bad for you to self examine and it’s great that you have support if you need it.",1686543924.0
jnrkwup,"Drugs that aren’t alcohol are considered an outside issue in AA. They’re only concerned with alcohol. NA is the fellowship that views all drugs and alcohol as haram, CMA does as well. If you bring outside issues into AA, you open yourself up for outside opinions on those outside issues. Will they co-sign you as being sober while smoking weed? Hell no. It’s a substance abuse and addiction recovery program, they’re not going to high five you or validate you for smoking weed. Feeling judged when you present an issue you know is going to be contentious in a recovery setting and getting the response you know will be coming is exactly what it sounds like. A program providing information about the program and the feedback or advice from the people within said program isn’t judgment, it’s what people go to programs to get. If you have issues with the suggested program of recovery in the voluntary program of AA or any of the others, you’re welcome to create your own program or find a program or recovery methodology that suits you. You just might be looking for a while because Dharma, Refuge, SMART, LifeRing, Stoic, WFS, Celebrate, SoS, NA, CMA, CA, DRA, MA and DAA all view it the same way. Abstinence from drugs and alcohol is viewed as recovery in every professional setting, every medical / psych setting, every program, every treatment model, every informed resource for addiction and recovery on earth with the exception of Moderation Management and the psychedelics 12 Step fellowship which I think got lost in a desert somewhere during COVID. The reason for this is they’ve all seen what happens when people who have a problem with X substance insist on continuing to use Y substance or think they can control one of the substances when they couldn’t control the other. The overwhelming majority can’t. Like, OVERWHELMING majority. As observed since 1935 to present day in hundreds of thousands of cases. Sure, maybe they could drink while they were doing heroin without drinking being an issue but when you pull the heroin? Drinking becomes the new heroin because the core issue of addressing one’s problems with substances is still there. Whatever maladaptive or external cope for what should be an inside job that slides into place after one is removed can become the new problem unless the bigger issues are dealt with via dedicated recovery efforts, and these are not substance specific issues. If I smoke a joint or do shrooms or LSD or have a cocktail, I’ll have a straw in my nose the same day. By the end of the week, it’ll be a glass pipe and within a few months it’ll be a needle. I’ve never used IV drugs and I never had a problem with alcohol but if this thing gets out of the box at this point in the game, I know that’s my trajectory. If I was good at doing drugs I’d still be doing them. I’d have all kinds of bullshit delusional self-deception whataboutisms and rationalizations why it’s a good thing and thoughts that I’m unique and this or that doesn’t apply to me and I can use successfully all over again the same way I did before I got clean. I cannot use anything successfully and I will turn any substance into a problem, I’m an addict. That’s addiction for the majority. Many try to rotate substances or hold on to this or that and many find out the hard way that it doesn’t work. If you can and that’s what you want to do, if abstinence isn’t what you want, go for it. Maybe they’re all wrong and you’re right. Other people’s opinions of you are none of your business. If it’s not a problem for you, I’d imagine there’s no need to make it one by putting it out there asking if anyone else has a problem with it.",1686480700.0

jj8uly8,"Largest, most recent (2020) and most comprehensive addiction recovery study review in human history by a significant margin, Cochrane also did the second largest one in 2006 which only included eight total reviewed studies. “We included 27 studies containing 10,565 participants (21 RCTs/quasi‐RCTs, 5 non‐randomized, and 1 purely economic study). The average age of participants within studies ranged from 34.2 to 51.0 years. AA/TSF was compared with psychological clinical interventions, such as MET and CBT, and other 12‐step program variants.” Results: “The evidence suggests that 42 % of participants participating in AA would remain completely abstinent one year later, compared to 35% of participants receiving other treatments including CBT. This effect is achieved largely by fostering increased AA participation beyond the end of the TSF program.” It did not preform worse than any other of the exhaustive list of alternative methodologies compared against it in any of the studies, 42% was the collective average of the review with many of the larger studies reviewed showing higher percentages. It also included the results of facilitation of AA in treatment / professional settings which are essentially a less effective form of the full program. There has not been other significant studies or reviews of this nature since as the Cochrane review was as far-reaching, comprehensive and decisive as we’re likely to see in our lifetimes. Academics and professionals have always wrote and sold books or presented alternative views that challenge the efficacy of twelve step programs, the validity of these efforts can be judged by the amount of and quality of data observed in their publications. The odds that anyone will be putting up or obtaining the funding for something as comprehensive as what the Cochrane review covered are are what one would reasonably expect them to be. Professional treatment also continues to follow the trends observed in the studies almost universally - They utilize the two most efficacious methodologies, twelve step facilitation and CBT-based process groups / counseling. If this is the gold standard via both professional and peer-assisted recovery, I’m not sure where having millions of dollars or a family or cost-benefit analysis in general falls in terms of efficacy, there may be studies on this I’m not aware of. Awful lot of dead addict millionaires throughout history. They even made an exclusive club for them, though entry was limited to those who were 27 years old. The popular television program “Celebrity Rehab” may be a useful case study in establishing validity on this theory.

I did not listen to mine, ended up needing surgery and then got hooked on pain meds after that. Turns out there is always a new bottom until it ends. But 21 months clean and sober now and mostly healthy. Yay! Definitely suggest that you make a plan for the weekend. Things you’re going to do to stay busy, clear all alcohol from the house, meetings you will attend, etc. If AA doesn’t feel right, there are lots of other recovery programs like Life Ring, Recovery Dharma, Smart Recovery and more. Just Google and try out some zoom meetings. The main thing is to make a connection somewhere with sober people. Connection is the antidote to addiction. I was fortunate that my husband was willing to give up drinking along with me. I hope your wife can do that to. It’s certainly worth asking her!

I would suggest get busy building a new life that you enjoy. For me that means an absolutely packed schedule. Exercise and proper nutrition has been super important as well. It's very hard to lose your old identity unless you start building something new you enjoy. I got out of 20 years substance abuse. I no longer want that life. I still get urges to get high but I am glad I didn't use. I don't want the pain and misery for very temporary relief. Stay sober for a while and give it an honest try.

I have my own space. I have STAIRS in my place lol. It strangely satisfies me so much that I have stairs. Personally, the addiction has been on full court press the whole time. However, I have a solid support group who I can reach out to whenever. But that group was earned by going to many meetings and putting myself out there. I took the risk and others took the risk of opening up to me. I have since rolled my addictive nature into something positive.

I have a suspicion that counting days is actually counter-productive. Like if you fuck up once counting days can put you on an emotional downward spiral. You get the feeling you have to start over, start at square one. You become primed to lose everything: friends, job, your stuff, your housing situation.

jeuyzl4,"Good for you man, keep at it. They easiest thing to do is to keep making progress. The catch is, making progress can feel like the hardest thing to do. What seems to work best is to focus on just doing the work to make progress. 12 step programs work because they are focused on getting people to do the work. It's referred to in its simplest form as, ""doing the next right thing"". Another simple one is, ""feelings aren't facts"". When doing the next right thing/making progress feels overwhelming just focus on doing the work that goes into it. For example, you're sleeping like shit right now because you're playing to much runescape. Instead of playing runescape, force yourself to get into bed with a TV show on. My go-to is anything that I've seen before, muted, with sub-titles on. If you think about it, how much more does watching TV suck than playing runescape? Not by much but it can feel like so much worse. Yeah, you might be up late for awhile watching TV but by not playing runescape, you have made some progress. Making progress, little by little, makes the next bit of progress feel more manageable. Caveat here is I'm only suggesting this as you aren't currently drinking/drugging. The true purpose of sobriety/12 steps is to really analyze these character defects or ""isms"" and turn them over to a higher power. What you're discovering is that as much as alcohol/drugs were problems, they are also solutions to other problems. Take away the substances and we are still left with problems, defects, ""isms"", w/e you wanna call them. Another simple yet underlying concept to 12 step programs is, ""progress, not perfection"". Putting in the work to make progress is often easier than striving for perfection. I'm 3 years sober in AA. I still have character defects. Sometimes I have less than ideal ""coping mechanisms"". I have to keep an eye on how I watch TV. Much like you said regarding, ""getting sucked into video games"" I'll get sucked into a TV show. Easy way to escape reality. I'm not perfect but I'm sober, life is immensely better and I keep a commitment to a recovery program. I still make progress and have ""failsafes""/means of accountability to kick me back into more action when I need to. Therapy is great, I got back into it a few months ago myself.

The first step in NA says that we are powerless over our addiction and that our lives had become unmanageable. My problem has never been a single substance but a variety of substances, and it's not just illegal substances but any sort of behavior that I can use to keep myself from being present in the moment. Sex, food, exercise, caffeine, porno, gambling, sugar, work, computers, relationships—you name it—are all various components I can use to avoid being present and accountable in my life and the lives of others. For my money, NA works best as it's a big, huge tent and all diseases, obsessions & compulsions can easily can fit neatly under that huge piece of canvass. I came into NA seeking ""freedom from active addiction"" and I was given so much more than just that. I would strongly suggest that you start with just one 12-step group and not a half-dozen.

jdlhupi,"I’m 6 years sober as of last November and during that time I had one sponsor (she went back out just after I got my 1 year chip) and sponsored a few people who also went back out. It got me to thinking that the whole sponsor thing was maybe a thing that wasn’t working for me and, as I have learned, AA does not have to be bought hook, line & sinker. We ARE able to take what works and leave the rest behind. We are under no obligation to do anything in AA except to get ourselves sober and if for some of us the responsibility of sponsorship is burdensome then they should be free (in my opinion) to leave that to others. If your sponsor is pressuring you to do anything that you are not fully onboard for then perhaps it’s time to leave that person and either find a new sponsor or forgo it altogether. There are step-groups that you can do the steps with if you’d like also. You do not have to do it with one person. In The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous it says right in it on page 164 “this book is suggestive only. We admit to we know only a little…”. Right there they tell us that we are not required of doing every single thing within its pages. Sponsorship back in Bill and Dr. Bob’s time was actually a literal monetary sponsor who put up the payment for the hospital bills for their sponsee to dry out. Then they showed them the lay of the land. So it’s been an evolution, the role of sponsor, and as it evolves so to can we evolve out of the notion that we have to have one or be one.

I suppose most Smart Rec advocates would say I am just choosing to be guided by a magical way of thinking such as that suggested in the 12 steps.

I also think 12 steps can become a self fulfilling prophecy (tell a young person who may just be poorly coping that they are an addict, they start to act like an addict and use heavier substances.) However, despite the drawbacks which I really do think should be criticized more openly by psychologists and treatment centers, I also believe if someone actively works to apply the 12 steps, there is really something there that can be of great healing. I am partial to a theory of biology and cognitive science that doesn't presume to explain away everything in terms of all that is presently known about chemistry, and the foundations of SMART, essentially rest on the MacLean brain hypotheses which has been largely refuted by more recent neuroscientists, relies on just that pretension of having the knowledge to explain things away. Not all that partial to Carl Jung but I think he was spot on when he said ""addicts are frustrated mystics.""",1679201656.0
jcn50w4,"AA and getting long term sobriety made it possible for me to actively participate in my health care (both mental and physical). If I had a sponsee talking to me about this list of issues, I would suggest they talk to their GP and possibly get some testing done. I’ve been brutally anemic at various points over my sobriety (during pregnancy/postpartum) and finding out I needed iron infusions was a game changer for me. One of the gifts of sobriety, for me, is being present enough to notice when things need attention, from weird joint pain to getting diagnosed with ADHD. It’s also worth exploring Zoom meetings you can attend from home. You can connect with newcomers and carry the message in so many ways in this age, it’s truly incredible. Take good care of yourself.

I straight up told the counselor that because I never had a problem with weed that I would continue using it. I've never seen it as a problem. Without any judgement he suggested that I do absolutely nothing for a year. No substances whatsoever. I was told that I had to learn how to deal with all of my shit and not have any outside forces that would ever make me feel different. I thought it was a bit crazy, but the way that he had suggested it was so mellow and kind and so that's what I did. And I'm really glad that I did. I couldn't rely on anything to alter my state of mind and I had to learn how to observe discomfort and let it pass. It was really hard that first year. I don't think that I would have had any cross addictions which can happen when one quits the substance they were addicted to, but I would have very likely had some serious discomfort and that I'd want to change my mindset using some kind of chemical. What made it even more difficult is that like you, I was prescribed a benzo for sleeping and I quit that as well. Almost five years in and I do now smoke a little weed and I'm not against psychedelics, but it's rare. So I say this without any judgement whatsoever... I do think that there's value in dropping everything for a year and giving the effort to deal with whatever comes your way without some kind of escape...

j9d6r2l,"_USERNAME_ hit the nail on the head with this one. It's a complicated situation that is best handled with a simple approach. Having a loved one suffering from addiction is so extremely difficult. There are so many questions without clear answers let alone right or wrong responses. Everyone is unique and knowing what to do in each situation is difficult. This being said take some solace that your brother has a wonderful family in his life that cares for him very much. This is more than many have. He has a lifeline if he needs to use it. At the end of the day he has to choose to do so however. If he is responding via text, just keep texting him a few times a day. Let him know you love him and are there for him. No one can know if flying out sooner will make a difference or not. If you can get a response from him, then try asking first. Maybe say something along the lines of an earlier arrival working better for your schedule. Work or personal if you feel a need to clarify. Edit: has he been to treatment before? Either way he should go. If he hasn't its definitely something you should suggest. When and how are more difficult questions. If you are going to see him soon it might be better to do so then.

j93yffk,"A couple thoughts: 1) The Big Book is a product of its times. Obviously, attitudes have changed a lot since it was written. It’s been kept as it was written in large part because people who got sober using it are reluctant to make any changes to what’s already working for them. They’d probably say, “I agree the chapter is sexist. But are you going to put combating sexism ahead of your recovery?” A very great deal of recovery is learning how to live with things that are outrageously, obnoxiously wrong-headed without reaching for substances. The very worst resentments are the ones that are fully justified, precisely because they’re fully justified and thus difficult to let go of. So perhaps part of your recovery is learning to accept the Big Book warts and all and still taking the useful parts of it and applying them to yourself. 2) If it’s just too much for you to stomach, may I suggest that you check out Narcotics Anonymous? They are completely agnostic with respect to the various substances. Alcohol, coke, meth, opiates: they all fall under the umbrella of addiction. Their Basic Text is not without its own flaws, but it was composed at a much later date and is much better than the Big Book when it comes to sexism, classism, etc. 3) You may be tempted to say in frustration, “How could Bill W. have been so blind? Surely, he could see how wrong it was to cater so specifically to well off, white men?” It’s all too easy to judge people from the past by the standards of the present. Here’s a news flash: I guarantee that opinions you hold or practices you have will be regarded by future generations as absolutely barbaric. “How could you have possibly thought that using Reddit was ever a good idea? Only monsters are Redditers!” The same can be said of any figure from history. Abraham Lincoln had horrific opinions. Marcus Aurelius was a despot. This is why blind heroism is always problematic…all human beings are necessarily flawed by the standards of their own day, so they haven’t got a prayer of measuring up to the standards of subsequent generations. Especially considering they have no way of knowing what those future standards will be. So cut Bill a little slack here. Take the good, ignore the rest, and focus on recovery.",1676770760.0

Two months of every day benzodiazepine use (and you were on the highest available single dose of Xanax) can result in withdrawal for some people: possible seizures, psychosis, death, and a basically just a hell of a bad time you really don’t need to go through.

This is a voluntary spiritual fellowship, and if we didn't graciously support people leaving as graciously as we invited them in, then we aren't living up to any values worth supporting.

It suggests working side by side with other alcoholics. I've had some bad experiences with gurus and power-trippers so I find this works quite well for me. No one person, no one group, is an authority on AA. Just like nobody is an authority on god. If they were, then this truly would be a cult. Some people, some groups insist on trying to pull it in that direction. I won't lie, there's plenty of that out there. I wish there weren't. Maybe it's human nature.

j6m3wnq,"I’m from Australia & can only speak from my own experience but YES! I was a poly substance user & threw myself into a rehab 14yrs ago. Everything was taken including my phone. It was Friday so no Dr was expected until Monday to prescribe anything & I just had to “wait my turn….” During that time, I began withdrawing from opioids, benzos etc, my BP shot thru the roof (I could tell being a nurse) & I was expected to participate in activities while feeling like death! I discharged myself with a lot of drama & regrouped (still in a poly substance mess). I found a Shrink who was kind. He actually went to prisons to start withdrawing inmates onto Suboxone. I bawled my eyes out, confessed to every embarrassing thing & he calmly said “let’s tackle one thing at a time”. He started me on Suboxone & kept raising my dose until cravings went (didn’t take long). I happily stayed on Subs for 12yrs & quit drinking & smoking - everything just dropped away naturally except benzos which was happy to keep prescribing as long as I tried not to increase my consumption & I haven’t wanted to. Due to developing chronic back pain & feeling stigmatised by the medical profession, I self tapered off my Subs 25 days ago. It was a painless taper & no cravings have returned. My pain’s been better & Dr’s now listen to me. I’ve kept the same Shrink & had therapy over the yrs. I still have my husband & son - neither of them know what I’ve been through bc I was managed so well. I’ve been feeling a bit depressed since quitting Subs & my Shrink has suggested a mental health rehab - not one for addicts. I found that such a reassuring thought. So I hope you can break it down like I did with a good Psychiatrist who doesn’t want to rush anything. Don’t listen to the Suboxone horror stories. If I can taper off 32mg in 4 months, anyone can. My shrink never pushed me to do anything. With time, I sorted myself out & will probably stay on valium & Lyrica for many yrs to come bc they work wonders for my sciatica, compressed vertebrae etc. I haven’t wanted an opioid but if I needed some, I’d consult my shrink first.

Go If for some reason you do not vibe after you’ve given it ample chances I’ve had a lot of success on zoom AA. 247 All types of people go to AAA drug attic‘s and alcoholics hi bottomlow bottom. There is a solution. I know you’re busy with work and life and maybe you’re trying to move but here’s what I would do or suggest. Go to a meeting every day it’s the first thing you do after that take care of the rest of your life. There’s some kind hearted warm loving people in those rooms you’ll see Just know that I am wishing you the very best on your path to a happy destiny you deserve to be happy you’re not a bad person you made some poor choices and you got caught up happens to the best of us we do recover we can be husbands wives family members employees Etc.,1674425799.0
j5fzmvw,"Dependence, though I would agree there's a slim line. It's become a ritual like anything else in my life and when it was pulled out from under me I was fine. I kind of wish my GP didn't suggest I go back on it given he was the one who took me off. I had to increase the dose, that was such a tiny dose and eventually it just took more to work. I wouldn't go out sucking dick for Valium or do anything I wouldn't want to. Would I for THC? ...almost, and that says a lot. That's the one drug I can say I am very addicted to, but it fits my brain like the perfect puzzle piece that it is. However it's legal here and not pricey so I would never have to do that. Prior to being pulled off Valium I did DMT for a month straight, and even that started to feel addicting, more addicting than Valium. But again it was partly the ritual. At first it was scary and then I couldn't wait to do it every night. It's like a factory reset button on my brain. DMT isn't considered an addictive drug at all, and yet I felt more addicted to that than Valium at any point. But any drug that you can enjoy or give you a profound experience like that, of course it can be mentally addicting. When I can figure out how to properly prepare kava, that will replace this. Kava is incredible stuff, but I need to learn how to properly prep it. Micronized ruins my guts. This stuff at least is very safe and has no withdrawals like benzos or really in general. Kava makes me feel great, Valium just calms me down. THC is the king regardless though. Valium doesn't hold a candle to it. I've at least been working on reducing my dose gradually. But I know I can't CT Valium with just Kava. Maybe, my dose isn't that high and I was fine last time but I had Gabapentin on hand. I've messed around with some harder stuff like Phenibut too, this is like, one of the most addictive drugs ever, and it does make me feel amazing, but I've had no problems only taking it once or twice a month. Actually I kind of dislike it a lot due to how long it lasts and how awful I feel the next day. It feels like a very dirty high.",1674414797.0
j5cw5tj,"If you are not familiar with the AA steps, It will not make sense to you. If a person wants to be free of certain resentments, even extremely old, or harsh ones, there is a process that one can apply. Harboring resentment is like taking poison and hoping the other person suffers. Holding someone in contempt in your mind for 18 years, does nothing to the other. But, we suffer on a daily basis. And yes, of course, there are exceptions. But, in most cases when it comes to relationships, family issues of abuse, and involving people that we know, (as stated in the original post.) The victim often has a less than healthy role in the incident or longer term situation. The steps don't ask you to proclaim the person innocent, They give direction on how to identify the unhealthy behavior that put you in that situation, learn how you may have been complicit, and free yourself from the long term fall-out and baggage. I have my own personal experience with this or I would not have suggested it. The steps are an extreme refuge. But, if you want to be free, you'll do what we did.,",1674353024.0

Op unless you are disabled and these people are your caretakers, I think you probably could find a way to cut them out of your life.

j4ytmbi,"Exactly. I was going to say, I attend a meeting as often as I used to use. Which was everyday. And it was usually all day/night long till i passed out, so a meeting is actually a pretty good time trade off. By doing this along with the other stuff my sponsor suggested, the void I was trying to fill with drugs/alcohol is no longer there. Otherwise I'd just be white knuckling it.

You did something so powerful. I am proud of you. I do not suggest you talk this out with your partner just yet. You need to talk with someone who understands us. I tried talking to a number of people at first, and they were all so kind, so sweet, but none of them understood. I started going to all the different recovery meetings, and I found our people. They understand us. It was like all this time, I was a zebra hanging around horses. Then, I finally found a bunch of zebras. I could talk about shame, fear, hope, while laughing and crying in the same sentence, and everyone understood where I was. I couldn't do that around normal people all the time.

When our canned responses as 12 -steppers keep us from speaking from a place of knowledge, that’s where a lot of trauma lives. Everyone is an individual. The goal is abstinence and progress. It is offered by both I’d also like to remind everyone that AA’s Big Book literally suggests to try other methods of abstinence. Then they say, come see us if it doesn’t work. The canned response of “you might be able to do it, I could not” is belittling. Especially if you have no knowledge of what is being discussed (12 steps vs four principals)",1673831119.0

j4dvanh,"Respect to you and the family who’ve stuck with him. It’s an incredibly hard journey. For what it’s worth - people do still recover from the deep dark but it’s a long way home. The tragedy of addiction is the person isn’t experiencing highs at all, more lows of increasing depths and they use drugs to try to feel normal or induce functions in their brain that have been short circuited by repetitive use of drugs. While it may not be any kind of relief the fact that he’s still trying to get his job back suggests he at least has a connection with reality and some kind of desire to re-engage (I appreciate this may not be the full truth and is cold comfort - I’m just comparing it to people I know who are without an anchor of any kind, no job, no relationship, no family who are truly unmoored). Knowing such things are highly subjective and that this behaviour sounds like it’s a manifestation of deep addiction - it doesn’t like behaviour that’s as insane as much of what I’ve seen from friends who’ve wound up deep down the rabbit hole, though it’s on the way. In my experience - where someone reaches the point where they’re displaying delusions, paranoia, or symptoms of psychosis they’re often addicted to multiple substances and display radically different personality traits depending on what they’ve just taken. Where someone is ignoring basic social norms - I.e. emailing the boss constantly, believing they’re entitled to special privileges - it could be a function of symptoms similar to mania in bipolar. That depends on what your husband has been consuming - long periods of alcohol addiction can reduce emotional control, working memory, impulse control. If stimulants are involved they can lead to delusional/psychotic episodes - or just a pattern of that thinking that’s disconnected from reality. For example I’ve been trying to talk a friend out of a conviction that the government is dropping stories on his phone and hacking it on a weekly basis. Same friend believes that his boss hates him and doesn’t respect his work (though he also struggles with a high degree of self loathing and self esteem stuff).",1673743310.0

j3aba5f,"Well if you have significant clean time, and you do turn out to have ADHD my claim is that it’s entirely possible to take the medication as prescribed in a healthy manner. I don’t know what your illness is or what you have going on but it certainly sounds familiar. The best way to head down that road is to start treatment with a provider, and have an open mind. Without already having been on an ADHD med for some time most providers nowadays will think twice before just handing out an ADHD med. It’s easily possible that another kind of med could target your depression and the like, but you can maintain a relationship with a provider and try things. But some providers are more willing to use ADHD treatment than others and if ADHD is really your illness, you might wind up on the right med for it after building a rapport with a provider or you might wind up with a close minded one and need to continue treatment elsewhere. To me what is unnerving is how inconsistent and scattered that treatment plans and outcomes tend to be. It was only by chance that I had a provider who recognized my ADHD after looking at my history of erratic and risky behavior and she did it without me pushing for it. The name of the game is it can take a lot of time but you’ll eventually figure out what is wrong if you put enough patience and persistence of signing up for psych care. I’m comfortable suggesting trying psych care for you just because you wouldn’t be here if you were in fantastic mental health. The great news is once you find a medication that works for you and you keep taking it, it gets easier and easier to STAY on that medication, when you stick with your provider and build records and rapport.",1673060399.0

j3026p3,"I would suggest looking into an Oxford House. It sounds like you are currently in a 1/2 way. Oxford will be able to provide the freedom that you seem to be searching for. There is no staff in an Oxford House and the house itself is fully self-supporting. Full-time employment is a requirement, and you are able to have your car and come and go as you please. Restrictions are: curfew and absolutely zero tolerance for drinking and drugging (you will be kicked out if you use) you are able to have guests as long as they are not under the influence of anything and their ""black out"" period is nothing (ours is 10 pm curfew Sunday-Thursday, midnight curfew Friday and Saturday, no overnights guest during this time and you have to actively be doing a set amount of meetings). It is also a requirement that members are active in their program of recovery but that stretches from AA, NA, Refuge Recovery, Smart Recovery...really whatever path feels natural to you. The great thing about it though is that it gives you the opportunity to prove to yourself and your loved ones (if that is the case) that you are able to be trusted. I came into my house with reservations of smoking weed once I felt like I could stand back on my own, but my time here has shown me that I really could care less about the substances. Just something to think about if your parents are suggesting this sort of route (sober living) this path has much more freedom, although you are trusted to hold both yourself and your other house members accountable for yours and their actions.
